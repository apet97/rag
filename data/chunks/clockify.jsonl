User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Log in # To start tracking time in the app, you\u2019ll first need to log in to your Clockify account. There are a couple of ways in which you can do that: Enter email you used to create Clockify account and Continue with Email Choose to Continue with Google if you\u2019ve associated your Clockify account with your Google account If you don\u2019t have a Clockify account yet, you can create it by tapping the Sign up button in the upper right corner.

Time tracking # It is possible to track your time in Clockify Android app in two different ways, either by using a timer or adding time manually. Clockify groups similar time entries under one expandable entry. If you wish to see entries in chronological order, go to Profile settings > Preferences in the web app and turn off Group similar time entries . Autocomplete There\u2019s an autocomplete option available when you tap on an entry and start typing a description. Timer mode # To start a timer: Tap + button in the lower right corner and a time entry screen will appear Choose and tap the Play button on the bottom right corner to begin working Fill the details (description, project, task, billability, tags) Tap the Stop button to stop the timer and save the time entry or the Discard option in the upper right corner to discard the time entry Add time manually # To manually add a time entry: Tap + button in the bottom right corner Choose Manual option Type in the time to set the duration of the time entry OR Tap on the start/end option on the top left corner to specify start/end time, and date Fill in the details (description, project, task, billability, tags) Tap the Save button to save the time entry or the Discard button in the upper right corner to discard the time entry You can type in the time if you tap the numbers on the scroller rather than scrolling through the numbers to get to the hour you need. Add/subtract duration shortcuts # In order to optimize the process of modifying entries, when adding time manually, you can easily add duration by using the shortcut buttons located below the duration field. The following time spans can be added: -1h -0.25h +0.25h +1h The value displayed on the shortcut buttons is based on the duration of the entry (e.g. if duration is less than an hour, the -1 button is disabled). Click on one of the buttons, and that value will be added/subtracted from the tracked time. Shortcut buttons are not available for running entries, only when adding time manually. Edit time entry # To edit a time entry simply tap on the entry itself and an Edit time entry screen will appear where you can: Edit start and end time, as well as the date by tapping the Start/End option in the upper left corner Select task and project (plus create projects and tasks from within the app) Edit time description Mark time entry as billable Add/remove tags (plus create them) On the Time tracker screen, when you tap the three little dots in the time entry card you\u2019ll find more options: Continue that time entry Duplicate that time entry Delete the time entry You can also continue a previous time entry from the Time tracker list by tapping the play button on the time entry (just below the three little dots).

If all required fields are not populated, then the Timer screen opens and you will be prompted to fill out the required fields. Custom fields are currently not available on widgets. Track again # This widget displays 4 most recently tracked entries. You can choose one and start the timer. When you tap play on any of the entries, timer starts again. If you tap on any place within the widget, Clockify app opens. If you tap again on a widget with a running entry again, the timer will stop. There is a default widget size. However, the widget can be resized (reduce size, enlarge). If timer doesn\u2019t have all required fields, Time entry details opens for you to fill out. Track break # If you\u2019ve enabled the widget, you can see a tracking break icon alongside other icons on the widget when tracking time as a break. This way, you can easily see the difference between tracing work and break time without needing to open the app. In this case, the time is tracked as a break entry type.

This guide will walk you through the process of approving time entries and time off requests, including how to edit, reject, and send reminders. Key concepts # Time entries : Hours tracked by team members for their work on various projects or tasks Time off requests : Requests submitted by employees to take time off, such as vacation or sick leave Approval workflow : The process by which you review and either approve or reject time entries and time off requests Access permissions # Workspace Admins and Owners can approve, reject, and edit time entries and time off requests for all team members Team managers (if enabled) can approve, reject, and edit the time entries and requests for users they manage Project managers (if enabled) can approve or reject time entries and time off requests for team members working on their assigned projects Configure approval permissions # To configure approval permissions for your workspace: Navigate to Workspace settings > Permissions tab In the Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses section, choose: Admins & Team managers : Team members can approve time entries for users they manage Admins & Project managers : Project managers can approve time entries for users on their assigned projects If a user has both Admin and Manager roles, the Admin role will override the other roles. For example, an Admin who is also a Team Manager will have the permissions of both roles. Approve time entries # To approve or reject time entries: Go to the Approvals page in your dashboard In the Pending tab , you\u2019ll see time entries waiting for approval. Each entry will show the author , time , and status (e.g. pending, approved, rejected) Review time entries # Each time entry will include: User name : Team member who submitted time Project and task : Project or task to which the time is assigned Logged time : Number of hours worked Description : Notes or description provided by the team member You can filter the entries by user, group, or date range to make it easier to review. Approve or reject time entries # Approve time entry : If everything looks good, click the Approve button. The entry will be marked as approved and locked. Reject time entry : If there are issues with the entry (e.g. incorrect hours), click Reject . A prompt will ask you to leave a rejection note. The user will be notified of the rejection via email. Bulk approve or reject time entries # To approve or reject multiple time entries at once: Select the checkboxes next to the entries you wish to approve or reject Click the Approve or Reject button at the top of the page to apply your action to all selected entries Edit pending time entries # Admins can edit any user\u2019s pending time entries directly. Team managers can only edit pending time entries for their team members. To edit a pending time entry: Go to the Pending tab on the Approvals page Click on the edit pen icon next to the time entry In the Edit time entry screen, make the necessary changes: Adjust time and date Edit the description or project/task Change the billability status After making the necessary changes, click Save to finalize the change. Approval notifications # The user will receive an email notification when their time entry is approved The manager will be notified when a time entry is submitted for approval Admins will be notified when a user submits their timesheet (if they have the necessary Manager role for that user) Approve time off requests # Time off requests can be approved through the Requests tab under the Time Off page. Filter requests by status (pending, approved, rejected), by group or a specific team member or by a time range . Each request will show: Team member : The employee requesting time off Period : The start and end dates of the requested time off Requested time : Number of requested days/hours Policy : Policy under which the request has been submitted Status : Pending, approved, or rejected When you request a time off, the app checks your available balance. If you have insufficient leave, the request will appear in red and cannot be approved until the balance is adjusted. If negative balance is enabled, Clockify will display the number of negative days or hours allowed. If the request exceeds this limit, you won\u2019t be able to submit it. Approve or reject time off requests # To approve or reject a time off request: Go to the Time off page Find/filter out pending time off request in the Requests tab Click Approve or choose Reject from the three-dots menu If you reject the request, leave a note to explain the reason The user will receive an email notification if their request is approved or rejected Or open the email you received after the request has been submitted and approve/reject.

This way, time and budget spent on a project can be precisely estimated and allocated. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Approving tracked time is available on Standard and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers. Approving tracked expenses is available on PRO and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins, Project managers or Team managers. Imagine you are a project manager overseeing a team of developers working on a project for a client. Users working on a project submit tracked expenses during project-related activities, such as software licenses or travel expenses. As the project manager, you review these submissions to make sure they align with project and task budgets and client agreements. Once approved, these entries are integrated into project reports and invoices, providing clients with the billing information. Depending on the permissions defined in the Workspace settings , submitted time & expenses can be managed from the Approvals page in the following way: Admin: approve, reject, edit Team manager (if enabled): approve, reject, edit Project manager (if enabled): approve, reject To modify these permissions: Navigate to the Workspace settings > Permissions tab In the Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses section choose: Admins and team managers *Team members can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by their team members Admins & project managers *Project managers can approve timesheets and expenses submitted by members assigned to the projects they manage. *Admins can approve time for everyone. If a user has Admin and any other manager role, Admin role will override every other role. If a user has both Project and Team manager roles, they will have a union of permissions that combine both of these roles.

In addition to tracking billable hours, you should also track non-billable time (e.g. emails, Skype calls, preparing invoices, etc.).\u00a0You can\u2019t have a real insight into your financial state if you don\u2019t know how long tasks really take. Clockify helps you see how much billable vs non-billable activity you do and how that affects your earnings. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Let\u2019s say you have a new client and you want to track your billable rates. Here\u2019s what your Clockify workflow would look like: Set up projects # Define billable rate for each person in Team section and a default billable rate in Workspace Settings. Add a client on Clients page Create a new project in Projects section and select the client. If you want, you can also set up: Tasks , so you can select them when tracking time and later group time entries by task in reports Estimates , so you can compare estimated vs tracked time on projects, and budgeted vs spent money Project and task billable rates, so Clockify can use a different billable rate when calculating how much you\u2019ve earned on that particular project or task Track time # Start tracking time when you start working: type what you\u2019re working on, select the project, click $ to mark time as billable, and start the timer Stop the timer when you stop working and the time will be added to your timesheet When you continue working on something, press play icon next to the appropriate time entry to start the timer for that activity again. When you\u2019re having a meeting with the client, start the timer, type \u201cMeeting\u201d, choose project, and mark time as non-billable. By tracking non-billable time such as this, you\u2019ll have a more realistic picture of how much time you\u2019re really spending on the client (and not just the time you bill). You can also add a meeting tag so you can filter time entries by tags in Reports. See time breakdown in reports # When the time comes to bill your client at the end of the month, go to the Summary report , select This Month , the project (or only the client if you want to bill for multiple projects you do for them), show only billable time entries, and click Filter to see time entries you need to invoice. Group by Project and subgroup by Time Entry to make data breakdown more useful. Export the report with a detailed time breakdown in PDF and send it to your client for review. If you have clients who want to see how much time you\u2019ve tracked at any point, you can share\u00a0a report and send the link to your client. Then, your client can then visit the report at any time and see what work has been done so far on their projects. If you need to \u201cforgive\u201d and write-off some time entries, you can go to the Detailed report , use filters to find the time entries you want to write off, and mark them as non-billable. Invoice tracked time # Create invoice for client Import billable uninvoiced time entries into the invoice and download the PDF If you have time entries that you don\u2019t want to import into the invoice: you can select a different time range, choose which projects you don\u2019t need, or manually remove those entries Mark invoice as sent or paid to know its status See all your invoices that are due soon and filter out the paid ones Related articles # Create projects & clients Track time Summary report Create & manage invoices Invoice tracked time & expenses Was this article helpful?

Idle detection # While tracking time, Clockify browser extension can detect when you\u2019re away from your computer so you don\u2019t accidentally log that time. The extension detects when you\u2019re inactive based on your mouse and keyboard movements. If there\u2019s no mouse movement or keyboard strokes for X minutes, the timer will enter into idle mode. It will continue running, but it will treat those X minutes (and the time after that) as idle. When you become active, a notification will pop up, asking what you want to do with the idle time. You can choose to: Discard idle time \u2013 The timer will be stopped and the detected idle time will be removed from its total. Discard and continue \u2013 The current timer will be stopped, the detected idle time will be removed from its total, and a new timer will immediately start for the same activity.

To enable Pomodoro: Open the extension settings by clicking on the hamburger icon Go to Settings Check the Enable Pomodoro timer Timer interval \u2013 set how long will your Pomodoro session last. Short break \u2013 set how long will your short break last. Long break \u2013 set how long will your long break last and after how many short breaks it will occur. For example, if you set Long break starts after 3 short breaks your fourth break will be the long break. For Long Break to work you would need to start/stop the timer from the notification popup. If you stop the timer manually, it will reset the count sessions and will start over. If you have built-in notification sound enabled in Windows already, the notification will play both sounds so it\u2019s best to have just one option enabled. Disable/enable notification sound on Windows by going to Settings > System > Notifications & actions then click on the Google Chrome icon (note: this switch should still be set to ON) and switch off or on Play sound when the notification arrives . Default break project \u2013 Select the default project on which the break timer will be logged ( Last used project will take the project/task from the timer just before the break). Automatic breaks \u2013 You can choose to automatically start/stop the timer when the Pomodoro period or break ends. Focus mode \u2013 When enabled, your time logs will be hidden while you have the timer running and you\u2019ll just see a visual representation of time left. Start/stop automatically # You can automatically start/stop the timer when you open/close the browser so you don\u2019t have to worry about clocking in when you start working or clocking out when you finish with your work. Open the extension settings by clicking on the hamburger icon Go to Settings Check the Start timer when browser starts and/or Stop timer when browser closes If you shut down your PC and leave the browser open the timer will continue working. You would have to close the browser first and then turn off the computer in order for the timer to stop. In case you have both idle detection and auto-stop enabled, if the timer is stopped automatically, idle detection will not trigger (meaning idle time will be kept). To see more about how it works, follow this link. Notifications # Notifications are located under the bell icon at the top-right corner of the screen. Synchronization across platforms Notifications in the extensions sync with those on the web app. If you\u2019ve read notifications on the web app, they\u2019re marked as read in the Clockify extension. Visual indicators for new notifications New notifications are marked with an orange dot and a count. Click the bell to read them. Reminders # Simply check Remind to track time box in the Clockify browser extension settings, specify the interval (e.g. 10 minutes), and you will receive a notification from Clockify every 10 minutes, reminding you to use the timer. You can also set reminder start and end time , and the reminder notification will only appear during this time period (e.g. from 08:00 to 16:00). And, you can also set days for which you want to enable/disable reminders . If you don\u2019t want to receive reminders on Sundays for example, leave it unchecked.

Access permissions for bulk edit How to bulk edit time entries Additionally manage time entries Best practices FAQ Bulk edit time entries for your team 7 min read One of the responsibilities of a Manager is to make sure that there is accurate and up-to-date time tracking for your team. If you manage a large volume of time entries, the Bulk edit feature will help you improve this process. Here\u2019s how to make the most of this feature. What is bulk edit? # Bulk edit allows you to update multiple time entries at once. Whether you\u2019re adjusting tags, changing project details, or marking time entries as favorites, Bulk edit can save you time and ensure consistency across your team\u2019s time tracking. Access permissions for bulk edit # As a Team manager or Project manager , you have permission to bulk edit and bulk delete time entries. However, please note that Admins have the highest level of access and can configure workspace settings like required fields and general permissions. You\u2019ll have full control over your team\u2019s time entries but may need to coordinate with an Admin for certain settings. How to bulk edit time entries # You can bulk edit time entries directly from the Time tracker page: Go to the Time tracker page where your team\u2019s daily time entries are recorded Find the edit icon next to the total number of hours tracked for a specific day Click the edit icon, and bulk edit will be enabled for that day\u2019s time entries Once bulk edit is active, you can modify multiple time entries for that day at once. Update multiple time entries in the Detailed report # To update time entries across a larger time range, follow these steps: Go to the Detailed report Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to edit You can also use filters to narrow down which time entries you want to modify (e.g. by project, user, or date) After selecting the entries, click the Bulk edit button at the top of the table You\u2019ll be able to modify several fields, including: Tags Projects Tasks Description For each field you want to update, choose the new values. For example: Change the tags or assign the selected entries to a new project. Once you\u2019re done, click Save to apply the updates to all selected time entries. Add tags to time entries # When updating time entries in bulk, you have two options for handling tags : Existing tags will be replaced with the new tag you select If you want to add a new tag without replacing the old one, check the Add to existing option. This will allow multiple tags to be assigned to the same time entry. Mark time entries as favorites # This feature is available with paid plans. For easier access to frequently used time entries, you can mark them as favorites : Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to mark as favorites Choose the option to mark those entries as favorites Save This allows you to quickly access and track commonly used time entries in the Time tracker . Additionally manage time entries # Move time entries between workspaces # This is a paid feature and requires the workspace to be upgraded. If you need to transfer time entries from one workspace to another, you can do so using the Import timesheet feature: In the Detailed report , choose the date range and any necessary filters, then export the report as a CSV file Log into the destination workspace where you want to move the time entries Go to Settings > Import and upload the CSV file Follow the prompts to start the import process Delete time entries # If you need to remove a time entry, follow these steps: Select time entry Click the three dots on the right side of the time entry you want to delete Confirm by clicking Delete If you accidentally delete a time entry, you can undo the action by following the steps below. Undo a deleted time entry # If you are working in bulk and accidentally delete the wrong entry, you will be able to restore it with the Undo option. If you delete a time entry by mistake, you can easily undo the action: After you confirm the deletion, a toast notification will appear at the bottom of the screen with an Undo button You have 10 seconds to undo the deletion After you click Undo, the entry will be restored, including all data (e.g. project, tags, time spent). Best practices # When working with a large number of entries, it\u2019s helpful to filter your data by project, user, or date before selecting entries to edit. This ensures you only update the time entries you need to change. Bulk edits cannot be undone unless you use the Undo feature immediately. Always double-check the values you\u2019re updating before saving to avoid mistakes. If you frequently use tags for categorizing time, ensure they\u2019re consistently applied across your workspace.

Use required fields to prevent incomplete time entries, so that all entries have essential data like project, task, tag, and description and improve the accuracy and consistency of your reports. Required fields can be created on workspaces that are on all paid plans. To use required fiends as a Team manager or Project manager, you\u2019ll need your Admin to enable this feature in the Workspace settings. How required fields work # Once required fields are enabled, certain fields must be filled out before time entries can be saved or tracked. For example: If project and tag are marked as required, users cannot submit a time entry without selecting a project and tag. Also, the timer cannot be stopped until a project and tag are assigned. Even if the task field is optional, the project and tag fields will be mandatory. If a task is required, only projects with tasks will appear in the project picker. If no tasks exist for a project, that project will not be selectable for time tracking. Important to note : Only admins can set up and change required fields in the Workspace settings If a required field is missing, the system will prompt the user to complete the missing information before the time entry is finalized Tags # Tags are a powerful tool for categorizing time entries. By associating tags with time entries, you can easily filter and report on various types of work. Use tags to group time entries by specific tasks, clients, project types, or any other criteria relevant to your workflow. Tags make it easier to generate detailed reports and analyze where time is being spent across projects or teams. How tags work # Tags are mandatory when required fields are enabled, ensuring all time entries are categorized appropriately. You can use existing tags, or create new ones when entering time.

Manage tags # You can set up custom tags based on your project needs Tags can be assigned to projects, tasks, and time entries , providing flexibility in how you track and report time. Tips for effectively using required fields & tags # Make sure all team members use consistent tags for easy reporting and analysis Create a tag system (e.g. Client A > Research > Development) to keep entries organized Regularly review which fields should be marked as required to adjust it to your team\u2019s evolving needs FAQ # Can I set required fields for individual projects or tasks? # No, required fields are set at the workspace level and apply to all time entries across the workspace. This means you cannot designate different required fields for individual projects or tasks. For instance, if you mark the Project and Tag fields as required, then every user across all projects in the workspace will need to provide a project and a tag when logging time, regardless of the specific project or task. However, you can customize the required fields for your workspace as a whole by choosing which field (e.g. Project , Task , Tag , or Description) are mandatory for time entries. Can I disable required fields after enabling them? # Yes, you can modify the required fields at any time, but only admins have the permissions to do so. If you decide that certain fields no longer need to be mandatory (e.g. you no longer want the Description field to be required), you can go into the Workspace settings and disable that field. However, keep in mind that any changes made to the required fields will apply to all future time entries , and any time entries that were already submitted (even with missing information) will remain as they are. Can I use tags for more detailed reporting? # Absolutely! Tags are a powerful tool for categorizing and filtering your time entries. By using tags consistently across your workspace, you can easily generate reports based on the tags you\u2019ve assigned. For example, if you use tags for different project phases (e.g. Planning, Development, and Testing), you can filter your time entries to see how much time was spent in each phase. Similarly, tags can be used to differentiate between clients, types of work (e.g. Billable, Internal), or other relevant categories. Can required fields be applied to time entries logged via the mobile app or browser extension? # Yes, the required fields settings apply to time entries made across all platforms, including the mobile app and browser extension . If you attempt to log time via any device and the required fields (like Project or Tag ) are not completed, you will be prompted to fill in the missing information before you can save the entry. How do required fields impact existing time entries? # Required fields only affect new or updated time entries after they are enabled. If the required fields are set up in the middle of a project, time entries that have already been logged will not retroactively require the fields. However, from the moment the required fields are activated, any new time entries or updates to existing entries will need to meet the new requirements. This ensures that moving forward, all data logged is complete and organized. Can I customize which users are affected by required fields? # No, required fields apply to all users in the workspace once enabled, regardless of their role (e.g. Admin, Project Manager, Team Member).

I\u2019m being charged for more seats than I have team members # Clockify subscriptions are seat-based, which means that every active seat in your workspace is billed, regardless of whether a user is currently deactivated. If you\u2019ve deactivated users on the Team page but haven\u2019t adjusted your seat count, those seats will still remain on your subscription and continue to be charged. To lower your costs for the next billing cycle, you\u2019ll need to remove the extra seats manually. Here\u2019s how: Go to your Workspace Settings by clicking on the three dots next to your workspace name Select Subscription Find the current seat count and click Remove next to it Confirm the change If the Remove button is grayed out, that means you still have active users occupying all seats. In that case, first go to the Team page, find the user you\u2019d like to deactivate, click the three dots next to their name, and select Deactivate. Then return to the Subscription page to remove the seat. I can\u2019t add or remove seats # If the option to remove or add seats is grayed out on your Subscription page, there are a couple of possible reasons: You\u2019re paying via wire transfer In this case, you won\u2019t be able to manage seats directly from the app. Instead, you can either: Contact us at support@clockify.me , and we\u2019ll add the seats for you and issue an updated invoice. The minimum number of seats is five (5). Or, if you\u2019d prefer self-service, add credit card details to your account and purchase additional seats with the card. Clockify subscriptions are billed by credit card. Special conditions apply for wire transfer payments. If you\u2019d like to explore this option for larger purchases, please contact sales@clockify.me. Your invoice is overdue When there\u2019s an unpaid invoice on your account, the option to remove seats is disabled. To fix this: Process the latest invoice from your Invoices page. Or, reach out to our support team at support@clockify.me and we\u2019ll help you resolve it. Once the issue is cleared, you\u2019ll be able to add or remove seats normally. If your invoice is overdue and you\u2019d like to reduce the number of seats, our team can void the unpaid invoice and downgrade your workspace to the Free plan. From there, you\u2019ll be able to upgrade again with the preferred number of seats. Please keep in mind that this process may slightly change your settings and billing cycle (for example, you may need to re-enable certain paid features). My payment failed # If you have a valid subscription but your payment fails (for example, due to incorrect payment information, insufficient funds, or an expired credit card), you\u2019ll enter a two-week grace period. During this time: Go to the Subscription page Update your payment information Retry the payment manually, or wait for our payment processor to automatically retry the transaction If the payment isn\u2019t processed by the end of the grace period, your workspace will be downgraded to the free plan. You won\u2019t lose any data, but you will lose access to paid features. If you are unsure why your payment failed, here are a few things to check: 3D Secure : Make sure 3D Secure is enabled on your card. Without it, online transactions may be declined. Online payments : Confirm your card is authorized for online payments. Some cards have restrictions or require prior approval for internet transactions. I ssuing bank : Contact your bank to verify there aren\u2019t any blocks or restrictions on your card. Once everything is confirmed and corrected, retry updating your payment method on the Subscription page. My subscription renewed on an expired card # If your subscription was renewed using a card that has technically expired, this happens because of how payment processing works between Stripe (our payment processor) and your issuing bank. Clockify uses Stripe as a payment processor. If a card was saved in Stripe before its expiration date, Stripe may still attempt charges after it expires. Whether the charge goes through depends entirely on the issuing bank. In many cases, banks allow these charges to succeed to avoid disrupting recurring payments , giving customers time to update their payment method. If you\u2019d like to prevent this from happening again, we recommend updating your payment information on the Subscription page with your new card details. I can\u2019t change the country on the customer information page # If you\u2019d like to update the country in your billing details, keep in mind: Customers can\u2019t change the country field themselves If no country is set, or if you need to switch to a different one, please reach out to our support team at support@clockify.me Our billing team will update the country information for you Changing the country may also change the currency of your subscription, which requires adjustments to your billing setup from our team.

Why this happens: The Clockify API uses UTC time for all time-based values Sending a start time in local time (e.g., Brussels +1) without converting it to UTC may result in a start time that appears later than the end time.

Regenerate your API key: Click on your Profile picture and select Preferences Open the Advanced tab Click Generate next to the API key field If generating a report as a Project or a Team Manager: If amounts are restricted and you don\u2019t have access, use the following parameter in your request: \u201camountShown\u201d: \u201cHIDE_AMOUNT\u201d This will generate the report without including financial data. 401 \u2013 Unauthorized # This error means authentication failed, usually because the API key is missing, invalid, or not authorized to access the requested source. Why this happens: API key is missing, invalid, or incorrectly passed in the header API key is associated with a user who doesn\u2019t have access to the endpoint The current subscription plan doesn\u2019t support the requested feature How to fix it: Verify that the API key is included correctly X-Api-Key: your_api_key Check that the API key is valid: Click on your profile picture and select Preferences Open the Advanced tab Click Generate to create a new API key Ensure correct permissions The user tied to the API key must have access to the requested workspace, project, or feature.

Policy and holiday colors : The colors you\u2019ve defined for policies and holidays will appear throughout these pages, making it easy to identify types of leave. FAQ # Can I have different policies for different types of leave (vacation, sick leave, etc.)? Yes, you can create multiple time off policies and assign them to different members or groups based on the type of leave. What happens if I delete a policy? Deleting a policy will permanently remove all requests, balances, and approvals associated with that policy. Make sure to archive outdated policies if you want to keep the data intact. Can users see each other\u2019s time off requests? Admins can view all time off requests. Team managers can view time off for their team members. Regular users can only view their own time off, unless the setting Allow regular users to see time off outside their teams is enabled. How are holidays treated in time off requests? Holidays and weekends are automatically excluded from the total time off. If an employee requests time off over a holiday or weekend, those days are not counted toward their leave balance. How do I assign a holiday to specific people? When creating or editing a holiday, you can assign it to specific users or groups. This allows you to set different holidays for different members (e.g. national holidays for one group, but not another). Can I approve or reject time off requests for my team? Yes, as an Admin or Team manager, you can approve or reject time off requests for the users assigned to you. Can I track time off across multiple days? Yes, if your time off policy is set to days , you can allow half-day leave across multiple days. If it\u2019s set to hours , you can allow hourly requests across multiple days. Can I set up automatic accrual for time off policies? Yes, you can configure time off to automatically accrue on a monthly or yearly basis for all team members covered by the policy.

Invoicing is a paid feature, which you can use if you upgrade your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan. For step-by-step guidance on how to create and manage invoices in Clockify, watch the video and follow the instructions below. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Invoicing needs to be enabled in the Workspace settings . Create invoices # To create invoices: Go to the Invoices page Click Create invoice Choose client Change currency, invoice number, and issue/due dates (if needed) Click Create After you\u2019ve done that, you can also make some additional changes like: Manually add items to the invoice Import your tracked time and expenses Download the invoice Set taxation mode There are also some actions you can do such as to duplicate the existing invoice and quickly create a new one. Choose the invoice you\u2019d like to duplicate Click on the three dots menu Choose the Duplicate option from the dropdown This newly-created invoice contains the same information as the original one. This information can be changed and edited according to your needs. Any imported time entries won\u2019t carry over their dependency. Bill from , name , address and logo are taken from your Workspace settings , and Bill to address is taken from the client. To edit client address: Go to the Clients page Choose client Click the edit icon and edit their address Expand your contact list in the settings on the Invoices page. Once you add more contacts, they\u2019ll appear in the Bill from the dropdown on any invoice. Admins can access the Invoices page. You can allow specific members to also see and manage in workspace settings under the Who can manage invoices section. Set up recurring invoices # COMING SOON Save time and minimize errors by automating recurring invoices that repeat at custom intervals, weekly or monthly. Edit invoice # To edit an invoice: Go to the invoice you\u2019d like to edit Choose an action from the Actions dropdown in the upper right corner Choose one of the following actions: See all your invoices Filter invoices by status Mark invoices as Sent , Paid , Void Edit, delete, change status of an invoice Download expenses Record payment # Record payment option saves the invoice payment. To record invoice payment: Choose the Record payment option Record payment screen appears Date : Enter today\u2019s date Amount : Enter unpaid invoice amount you\u2019d like to mark as Paid Optionally change Date , Amount or add a Note Click Save to complete the action. As a result, invoice is marked as: Paid (you entered full amount) Partially paid : (you entered amount smaller than invoice amount) Amount is displayed in currency assigned to the client. Payments window # When an invoice is marked as Paid , you\u2019ll see the Payments option in the three-dot menu. This will open a list of all recorded payments for that invoice. The Payments window includes the following details: Date : The payment date Author : The person who made the payment Amount : The total amount paid Note : An optional field where you can add a note Invoice status # Invoice with Partially paid , Fully paid and Void status cannot be edited; In order to be edited, paid invoices need to be marked as either Unsent or Sent If invoice status is Partially paid , you can see all previously invoiced payments If record payment amount is negative number or zero, invoice can be immediately marked as Paid If due date for sent invoice passes, invoice gets an Overdue status If status is changed to Unsent , all previously processed payments are deleted All other invoices need to be processed through the Record payment option. Manually configure invoices # Clockify allows you to manually mark time entries and expenses as invoiced/uninvoiced. This way you have complete control over the invoicing workflow, accurate time and expense tracking without duplicated invoices errors. To manually mark time as invoiced: Go to the Detailed report Choose all time entries you need via Bulk edit Click on Mark as invoiced (next to Bulk edit in table header) Invoiced time entries have a green Invoiced tag next to them in the Detailed report . When you hover over the Invoiced tag, you\u2019ll see the client and the invoice ID under which the time entry was invoiced (unless it was manually marked as invoiced). By default, each new invoiceID is automatically assigned a unique number in sequence, such as invoice1, invoice2, invoice3, and so on, thanks to the auto-increment feature. To mark time as uninvoiced: Choose only invoiced time entries Click Mark as uninvoiced Conversion from clock to decimal format # Total amount between reports and invoices may slightly differ. Invoices round time on two decimals, while reports take more decimals into account. For example: You have a time entry whose duration is 20min, or 0.3333333h when converted to decimal format. When a report multiplies it with hourly rate of $100, the result in the report is $33.33. But when that entry is imported into an invoice, the invoice imports time rounded to two decimals (0.33h), which when multiplied with $100 equals $33.00. Grouping option may also result in different total amounts. For example: You have three entries on some project, each 20min. If you import time one by one with the Group hours: Detailed option, the invoice will make three line items of 0.33 and total amount will be $99.00 (3 x 0.33h x $100). But if you choose Group hours: Project option, they will be summed up and rounded using more decimals (like in the reports), resulting in $100.00 invoice.

Taxes # Tax fields in an invoice form shows the amount of tax added to the total price of a product or a service. Tax can either be a general amount added to the total, or broken down by the item, depending on the tax system used. Clockify uses item-based tax system. Item-based taxes # Item-based taxes are used to apply taxes individually to each item on an invoice. This way you can have a better control over your taxes, making sure that taxes are applied only to relevant items. This feature is available to users on Standard and higher subscription plans and on Free trial . In order to use it, the Invoicing feature needs to be enabled in the Workspace settings : Navigate to the workspace name at the top left corner of the page Open the three-dot menu and choose Workspace settings Navigate to the Invoicing section in the General settings and toggle the switch to enable it User permissions for this feature depend on the settings in the Permissions tab, in the Workspace settings. How item-based taxes work # When you create a new invoice, you will see two columns after the AMOUNT column: TAX (if only one tax is enabled) TAX 2 (if a second tax is enabled in the settings) Each item on the invoice has checkboxes next to the TAX and TAX 2 columns. By default, these checkboxes are checked (blue with a white tick), indicating that the taxes are applied. Unchecking them means that taxes will not be applied to that particular item. Taxes are calculated in the following way: TAX : This is calculated based on the percentage defined in the Invoice Settings TAX 2 : If enabled, this is also calculated as a percentage of the item amount Taxation mode # Taxation mode can be: Simple : Both taxes are applied to the total amount of the item E.g.: For an item priced at $100, with Tax 1 at 10% and Tax 2 at 10%, the calculated taxes will be $10 for each, making the total $120. Compound : The second tax is applied on the taxed amount, not the item amount. E.g.: For an item priced at $100, with Tax 1 at 10% and Tax 2 at 10%, Tax 1 is $10, and Tax 2 is calculated on the taxed amount, resulting in $11 for Tax 2 , making the total $121. The checkboxes for TAX and TAX 2 are remembered for each item on the invoice, meaning that the selected state is retained until the invoice is manually edited or changes are made to the tax settings. If you change the tax percentage during invoice creation, the totals will update automatically to reflect the new tax rates. If you switch from Simple to Compound or vice versa, all Unsent invoices will automatically update to match the new taxation settings. For example: Simple to Compound mode : The Apply tax checkbox will appear next to each item Compound to simple mode : The Tax and Tax 2 checkboxes will reappear If you remove one of the taxes from an invoice, then selected taxation mode will also be removed. If you add a previously removed tax, the system will remember the last selected taxation mode for that invoice. Set taxation mode on individual invoices # If you\u2019re using two taxes ( TAX and TAX 2 ) you can set a default taxation mode in the Invoice settings that will be applied to all new invoices. However, you can override these default settings for individual invoices when creating or editing. To do that: Open the invoice you\u2019re working on Scroll down to the Taxation mode section Choose whether Simple or Compound taxation mode should be applied to that specific invoice Taxation mode for a new invoice will not affect any invoices that are already Partially paid , Paid or Void . Filter invoices # You can filter invoices by: Status Issue date Client ID Bill from contact Amount To filter invoices: Go to the Invoices page Choose filter criteria at the top of the Invoices page: Date range Click Apply filter Client Status Amount Balance Invoice ID All invoices will be filtered out according to the selected criteria. Sort by time entry or expense details # When you create a new invoice or edit the existing one and import time and expenses, you can choose to display them according to the details in the Detailed view .

This way you can have a better control over your taxes, making sure that taxes are applied only to relevant items.\n\nThis feature is available to users on Standard and higher subscription plans and on Free trial .\n\nIn order to use it, the Invoicing feature needs to be enabled in the Workspace settings :\n\n1. Navigate to the workspace name at the top left corner of the page\n2. Open the three-dot menu and choose Workspace settings\n3. Navigate to the Invoicing section in the General settings and toggle the switch to enable it\n\nUser permissions for this feature depend on the settings in the Permissions tab, in the Workspace settings.\n\nHow item-based taxes work #\n\nWhen you create a new invoice, you will see two columns after the AMOUNT column:\n\n- TAX (if only one tax is enabled)\n- TAX 2 (if a second tax is enabled in the settings)\n\nEach item on the invoice has checkboxes next to the TAX and TAX 2 columns. By default, these checkboxes are checked (blue with a white tick), indicating that the taxes are applied. Unchecking them means that taxes will not be applied to that particular item.\n\nTaxes are calculated in the following way:\n\n- TAX : This is calculated based on the percentage defined in the Invoice Settings\n- TAX 2 : If enabled, this is also calculated as a percentage of the item amount\n\nTaxation mode #\n\nTaxation mode can be:\n\n- Simple : Both taxes are applied to the total amount of the item E.g.: For an item priced at $100, with Tax 1 at 10% and Tax 2 at 10%, the calculated taxes will be $10 for each, making the total $120.\n- Compound : The second tax is applied on the taxed amount, not the item amount. E.g.: For an item priced at $100, with Tax 1 at 10% and Tax 2 at 10%, Tax 1 is $10, and Tax 2 is calculated on the taxed amount, resulting in $11 for Tax 2 , making the total $121.\n\nThe checkboxes for TAX and TAX 2 are remembered for each item on the invoice, meaning that the selected state is retained until the invoice is manually edited or changes are made to the tax settings. If you change the tax percentage during invoice creation, the totals will update automatically to reflect the new tax rates. If you switch from Simple to Compound or vice versa, all Unsent invoices will automatically update to match the new taxation settings.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Simple to Compound mode : The Apply tax checkbox will appear next to each item\n- Compound to simple mode : The Tax and Tax 2 checkboxes will reappear\n\nIf you remove one of the taxes from an invoice, then selected taxation mode will also be removed. If you add a previously removed tax, the system will remember the last selected taxation mode for that invoice.\n\nSet taxation mode on individual invoices #\n\nIf you\u2019re using two taxes ( TAX and TAX 2 ) you can set a default taxation mode in the Invoice settings that will be applied to all new invoices. However, you can override these default settings for individual invoices when creating or editing.\n\nTo do that:\n\n1. Open the invoice you\u2019re working on\n2. Scroll down to the Taxation mode section\n3. Choose whether Simple or Compound taxation mode should be applied to that specific invoice\n\nTaxation mode for a new invoice will not affect any invoices that are already Partially paid , Paid or Void .", "tokens": 611, "node_type": "child", "section": "Item-based taxes", "anchor": "item-based-taxes", "breadcrumb": ["Clockify Help Center", "Projects", "Create & manage invoices"], "updated_at": "2025-10-16T04:48:31+00:00", "title_path": ["Clockify Help Center", "Projects", "Create & manage invoices", "Item-based taxes"]}

This will help your team organize their time, track progress, and optimize workflows. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about setting up, managing, and maintaining projects and clients in your workspace. Key concepts # Projects # Projects are essential for categorizing and grouping time entries based on the type of work being done. They help you analyze data, generate reports, and track the time spent on different tasks. A project can only belong to one client but a client can have multiple projects. Projects can be private (visible only to selected users) or public (visible to everyone in the workspace). Projects are useful for tracking time, setting estimates, assigning tasks, and reporting. Clients # Clients are the entities or individuals for whom you are doing work. Clients can be linked to multiple projects, and each project can belong to only one client. Create projects # As an Admin or Owner, you have the ability to create projects for your workspace. Here\u2019s how you can do it: Who can create projects? # By default, only Admins can create projects. However, this setting can be changed to allow Admins and Project Managers or Anyone in the workspace to create projects. You can modify this setting in Workspace settings . Steps to create a project: Go to the Projects page Click Create new project Enter project name Select a client If the client doesn\u2019t exist, you can create a new one right from the project creation screen if you type the name and click Create client Choose project color to help visually distinguish your project Set visibility Choose between Public or Private visibility Click Create Once the project is created, it will be available for time tracking. If the project is set to private , only users assigned to the project will be able to track time under it. Quickly create project # You can also create a project while creating a new time entry: In the Time tracker page, click on the +Project field Start typing the project name If the project doesn\u2019t exist, you\u2019ll be prompted to Create new project Enter the necessary details such as project name , client , visibility , etc. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter to quickly create a project. Manage projects # Archive projects # Once a project is completed, you can archive it to keep your workspace organized. Steps to archive project: Go to the Projects page Click the three dots next to the project name Select Archive You can choose to mark all tasks as done during this action Click Confirm to archive the project Restore archived projects # To access archived projects again: Change the Active filter to Archived at the top of the Projects page Click Apply filter To restore the project, click the three dots next to the archived project and select Restore Delete projects # You can delete a project only after it has been archived. Once deleted, the project will be removed from time entries but the time data remains intact. Steps to delete project: Go to the Projects page Change the filter to Archived or All Click the three dots next to the archived project name Select Delete and Confirm Merge projects # While it is not possible to directly merge projects , you can: Filter the time entries of one project and assign them to another project Use the bulk edit feature to update multiple time entries at once in the Detailed report Once you\u2019ve reassigned the time entries, you can archive and delete the project you no longer need. Manage project access & permissions # As a project manager , you have control over who can access the project, modify tasks, and track time under it. You can also assign users as project managers for specific projects. To learn more about how to manage users on a project, please refer to our Manage users on projects help article. Project status & notes # Each project can have a status (e.g. In progress, completed) to help track its progress. Project status : You can update the status as you track time and progress Project notes : Add additional context or instructions to the project by using the project note feature.

Projects make it easier to analyze data, generate more useful reports, and see where and how you spend time. Each project typically belongs to some client, but you can create a project without a client (e.g. internal company stuff). A client can have multiple projects, but a project can belong to only one client. You can also import projects and clients from a file. For an overall guidance on projects, watch the video and follow the instructions below. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Create projects # By default, only admins can create projects. However, this set of permissions can be modified if Who can create projects and clients is set to Admins and managers or Anyone in the Workspace settings . Who can create projects if selected: Admins (default): admins Admins and project managers : admins and project manager Anyone : admins, projects managers, team managers, regular users The person who creates the project automatically becomes its project manager meaning that they can view all tracked time on their projects, set estimates, add tasks, manage project access and modify all other aspects of the project. To create a project: Go to Projects and click Create new project Name the project Select client (you can also create a new client here, by typing a name and clicking Create client ) Choose a project color from the Custom section or color picker Choose visibility (public or private) Click Create Once you\u2019ve created a project, you can select it when tracking time. If you\u2019ve set the project as private (visible only to a certain group ), then only people who are on the project will be able to select it when tracking time. You can also adjust the size of columns (name, client, status, access) to make sure all data is properly displayed. If you use the Clockify browser extension, you can track time on projects and tasks from the Projects page. For more information, check out the Browser extension page. Quick create # You can also add a project directly from the project picker while creating a new time entry. Click on the +Project field to get a drop-down list of projects and start typing the name of your new project. Once you start typing the drop-down list will try to suggest a matching (existing) project name. If that project does not exist, you will be offered the option to create a new project. Click on the + Create new project button and a popup window with additional options will appear allowing you to name your project, assign a client, apply a project template and select if the project will be public or private. You can also use a keyboard shortcut Ctrl / ^ (Control) + Enter to quickly create a project without additional details. Color picker # The Custom section in the color picker for Projects allows you to save up to 8 custom colors. If you haven\u2019t used custom colors yet, the section will show a + sign prompting you to add new ones. Custom colors are consistent across all devices and modes. Archive projects # Once you complete a project, you can archive it, so it\u2019s no longer visible when tracking time. To archive a project: Go to the Projects page Click three dots next to the project you want to archive Select Archive You can check the Also mark all tasks as done box in a screen that pops up requiring you to confirm the action and all the tasks in the archived project will be marked as done . Once the project is archived you will be able to delete it. To see archived projects , click the Active filter at the top of the page, change it to Archived and click APPLY FILTER to confirm the action. To restore an archived project , click three dots next to it and select Restore . When you archive a project: All its data is still available Project\u2019s time entries will still be shown in reports Archived projects won\u2019t appear in reports as filters unless you select All or Archived Archived projects won\u2019t be available in the project picker when creating new time entries Archived projects won\u2019t appear on Projects page (unless you select Archived in the filter ) You can also archive tags and clients the same way you can archive projects. Delete projects # Projects can only be deleted once they are archived. To delete a project: Go to Projects page Select Archived or All from the drop-down menu Click three dots next to the archived project\u2019s name Select Delete Confirm the action Deleting a project will remove it from all time entries it is assigned to, but time will remain. Merge projects # While it\u2019s not possible to merge projects, you can filter entries of one of the projects you want to merge and assign it to the other project in the Detailed report . It is also possible to update multiple time entries at the same time with the Bulk edit feature in the Detailed report. Then, simply archive and delete the project you don\u2019t need.

Below are the most common reasons why imports fail and how to fix them. Required headers are missing or incorrect # Your CSV file must include the following required column headers, written in English. Project Client User Email Task Tag Start date Start time Duration You can find the full list of supported columns here . Headers must be spelled correctly in English, free of extra spaces or characters. If any of these are missing or incorrectly formatted, your import will fail. Date, time, and duration formats don\u2019t match Clockify settings # Clockify reads your CSV file based on your account and workspace formatting settings. The start date, start time, and duration fields must follow these settings. Date and time format: Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner Select \u201cPreferences.\u201d Under the General tab, check your Date and Time formats Duration format: Click on the three dots next to your workspace name Click on the \u201cWorkspace settings\u201d Under the General tab, check the Duration format: Decimal Full Compact Your CSV file must match these formats exactly; otherwise, the file will be rejected. Excel formatting issues # If you opened or edited your CSV file in Excel, it might have changed the formatting (e.g., dates, times, or stripped leading zeroes). This often breaks the import. To prevent that, we recommend opening and editing your CSV file in Google Sheets, which maintains correct formatting. The file is not comma-delimited # Clockify expects CSV files to use commas as delimiters. If your file uses semicolons instead, the import will not work. How to check if your file is comma-delimited: Open the CSV file in a plain text editor (like Notepad) Check the character separating values: If values are separated by commas, the format is correct If you see semicolons (;), you\u2019ll need to convert the delimiters to commas. You can also open the file in Google Sheets and re-download it as CSV. Google Sheets will automatically format it correctly using commas as delimiters. Missing or incomplete field values # Even if all required fields are present, your import can still fail if some fields are left empty in your CSV file. Check your workspace required field settings: Click on the three dots next to your workspace name Select \u201cWorkspace settings\u201d At the top of the page, check if the Timesheet is enabled. If it is, Project becomes a required field by default Scroll down to the \u201cDo not allow saving time without\u201d section to see if additional fields (e.g., Description, Task, Tag) are marked as required. If any of these required fields are empty in your CSV, the import will not succeed. Custom fields: If your workspace requires custom fields, you must also include those in your CSV, with valid data for each entry. To streamline the import process: Temporarily disable all required fields in your workspace settings Import only the essential time entry data After the import, re-enable your required fields This approach saves time and avoids needing to populate every single field in advance.

With custom fields, you can manually track: expenses, mileage, breaks, overtime, invoice status, number of units, custom dropdowns, quantity, codes, location, equipment, estimate, deal number, link to ticket, receipts, images, all sorts of IDs (invoice, task, user, project)\u2026 and more! In addition to user data, you can also track project metadata \u2013 perfect when you need to analyze data in pivot tables, or when you need to integrate Clockify with external systems via API . If you wish to add custom fields to users (like Employee ID), you can use user fields . Custom fields are a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan. Users can enter data into custom fields via: web, browser extension, iOS, Android, Mac and Windows. For an overall guidance on custom fields, watch the video and follow the instructions below. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Create fields # You can create custom fields in Workspace Settings > Custom Fields tab. You can have up to 50 fields in a workspace. When creating a field, you need to specify field type: Text \u2013 input field where you can type anything you wish (project ID, additional notes, coordinates) Number \u2013 input field that accepts only numerical values (mileage, expenses, number of units) Link \u2013 input field that accepts URL to websites or files (receipts, screenshots, documents, task reference) Switch \u2013 a simple yes/no switch (invoiced, paid, urgent) Select \u2013 input field that lets users select a single option from a pre-determined list (location, status, category) Select multiple \u2013 input field that lets users select any number of values from a pre-determined list (equipment used, custom tag list for a project) You can also prevent regular users from entering or changing data by settings Who can edit: Admins (for example, you can have Unpaid/Paid status which users can see but only admins can change). Use fields # In order for your users to see and use the fields you\u2019ve created, drag-and-drop the field to the Visible slot in Active column. Then, the fields will show up in Time Tracker and Timesheet for everyone in the workspace. In Timesheet, you can enter data for additional fields when you hover over a cell with time and click on the three dots. You can have up to 5 visible fields for the whole workspace, plus 5 more on projects. Fields function like regular inputs, depending on the field type you\u2019ve specified. Users can enter text, number, check a checkbox, or select from a list of predetermined values. When to use invisible fields Invisible fields are useful when you need to integrate Clockify with external systems via API, or you need entries to inherit additional metadata from projects (like project ID or project type) and you don\u2019t want to overburden your users with irrelevant data. If you activate a field and make it invisible, users won\u2019t see the field anywhere, but all created entries will have them. Entries can inherit value for invisible fields via project, or you can update them via API or some integration. Invisible fields and their data show up in Excel and CSV export of Detailed report. Set fields on projects # In addition to activating custom fields for the whole workspace, you can also activate them by project instead, as well as override visibility and default value in project settings. All invisible fields automatically show up in projects. You can set their default value for that project, plus make them visible (or invisible) when a user selects that project. You can have up to 10 visible fields on a project. In addition to managing active fields, you can also add a field from a list of available fields, so only entries on that particular project have that field. If you wish fields to have some default value when a user selects a project. For example, if a user selects ProjectX, a field Location can be set to USA , which the user can later override if it\u2019s not USA . Be careful with default values as they always override existing values. For example, if a time entry has My Value and then you change a project with a Default Value , it will overwrite My Value (you can re-enter My Value , but if you change a time entry\u2019s project again, My Value will be lost). A project manager can override a field\u2019s visibility and set a default value for their projects. Advanced usage # You can achieve any workflow you need by using these four mechanisms: Editing permission \u2013 You can let users edit data in a field for their time entries, or limit editing to admins only Visibility \u2013 Affects whether users can see a field in Time Tracker and Timesheet Default value \u2013 Fields on time entries start out as empty unless you prefill them with some default value Project overrides \u2013 You can override a field\u2019s visibility and default value by project For example, you can set a field as non-editable by regular users and visible only on certain projects. Or, you can make some field invisible and set a default value on projects so each time entry has its project metadata.

To do that, a time entry custom field needs to be set as Visible with a default value, or edited by Everyone . If configured properly, this custom field will appear in the workspace settings, under the Do not allow saving time without section, in the General tab. After selected in a checkbox, field will appear in a Time Tracker and Timesheet as a required field. So, next time a user would like to enter a time entry, they would need to insert the data in this required field. Edit and delete fields # Activating a field doesn\u2019t impact older entries. Only new time entries going forward will have custom fields and default values. To retroactively add fields to time entries, you\u2019ll have to manually update the time entries. If you move a field from Active to Available, new entries will stop having that field, but existing entries will retain their data and show up in exports. Deleting a custom field deletes that field and all its data from all time entries, across the whole workspace. Once you delete a field, it\u2019s like it never existed. There is no undo. To retain data, it\u2019s best to deactivate it by moving the field to Available column. If you edit the options of a Select type field, existing time entries will retain the original values. Unless: You manually change the value of Select type custom field on the time entry to a different value You change the project of the time entry to a project which has a default value set for this Select type field. In this case, the entry will get the default value for the Select type custom field of the project you selected. Edit custom field \u2013 example # Let\u2019s say you have a Select type custom field named Location with 3 select options: Los Angeles , New York , and Boston . You create a time entry and select Los Angeles as your location. Then you go to Workspace settings and rename Los Angeles option to San Francisco . The created entry will retain the value Los Angeles . If you edit the created entry and change its project to a project that has a default value for the Location field (e.g. New York) the entry will now have New York set as Location. In other words, default value will overwrite the original value any time you update an entry. Another example: let\u2019s say you create a field called Updated , set default value 2020 , and make it invisible. Your old entries won\u2019t have that field, but each entry moving forward will have it. If someone changes the project on their old entry, that entry will pick up the 2020 value even though it never had it, thus allowing you to see if some entry has been tampered with. Custom fields in reports # You can retrieve time entries with all their fields and data in Detailed Report via Excel and CSV export. Then, you can create all sorts of custom reports in pivot tables. You can see and edit the data for visible fields directly in the Detailed report. Additionally, admins can edit custom fields data other users have entered (regular members can only edit and delete time entries that belong to them). You can also use Bulk Edit to update Custom fields on multiple time entries with one click. Excel and CSV export list all active fields. If some entry has some value in some custom field that is no longer active in neither workspace nor some project, that field won\u2019t show up.

You can easily enable or disable what custom fields you\u2019d like to see as filters and use them when filtering the time entries. These filters are user-specific. When you add some custom fields to filters, this doesn\u2019t affect other users. Each user can have their own set of filters.

Choosing data regions (residency) mainly changes where your data is stored when it\u2019s not being used. It doesn\u2019t change how Clockify handles your data otherwise, or where other types of data are stored.

Enable required fields How it works What are custom fields? Create custom fields Make custom fields required Best practices for using required fields FAQ\n\nDefine required fields for time entries\n\n5 min read\n\nBy defining required fields for time entries, you\u2019re making sure that every entry contains the minimum amount of information needed to be created and saved. This helps you achieve accuracy and consistency across all time entries in your workspace. Required fields are available on paid plans, so you will need to upgrade your workspace to a Pro or Enterprise plan to access this functionality. Only Admins and Owners can enable required fields on a workspace. What are the required fields? # Required fields are mandatory fields that must be completed before a time entry can be created or saved. By defining which fields should be required, you make sure that time entries contain the necessary information for proper organization, reporting, and analysis. Enable required fields # Available required fields are predefined and are listed in the Workspace settings > General tab > Do not allow saving time without section. You can choose from the following fields to make mandatory for all time entries: Project Task Tag Description If Timesheet page is activated in your workspace settings, Project field becomes required . You must define a project for an entry to be saved. How it works # If you mark Project and Tag as required fields: Users will not be able to add a time entry without selecting a project and a tag The timer can be started, but it cannot be stopped until both fields are filled in Time entries will not save without these two fields For example, if Task is a required field, time entries linked to projects without tasks will not show up in the project picker, preventing incomplete time entries from being submitted. What are custom fields? # In addition to the standard required fields, you can add custom fields to track anything specific to your business needs. These could include: Expenses, mileage, breaks, overtime Invoice status, location, equipment Links to tickets, receipts, and more Only Workspace admins and owners have the permissions to configure custom fields. Create custom fields # To create custom fields for time entries: Go to Workspace settings > Custom fields Click on Create new field and select the field type: Text : Free-text input Number : Only numerical values (e.g. mileage, expenses) Link : URLs (e.g. links to receipts) Switch : Yes/No options (e.g. paid/unpaid) Select : Dropdown list (e.g. status, location) Select multiple : Allows multiple selections (e.g. equipment used) Make custom fields required # To set a custom field as required for every time entry: Make sure the field is Visible with a default value, or editable by users In Workspace settings , under the General tab, select the checkbox for the custom field in the Do not allow saving time without section The field will now appear as a required field in both Time tracker and Timesheet , ensuring all users fill it out when entering time Best practices for using required fields # Make sure your required fields are the same across all projects and workspaces e.g. Let\u2019s say that as a marketing manager you need to track [Campaign name] for every time entry. If you make this a required field for your [Social media] project but not for your [Email marketing] project, your company reports will have missing data. By making [Campaign name] a required field for all projects, your data stays clean and complete, making it easy to run reports later. Use custom fields to track key business information you need for reports and analysis e.g. Your sof tware development team needs to prioritize bugs. You create a custom field called Bug priority with options like high , medium , and low . By requiring your team to fill this out for every bug-related time entry, you can quickly filter your reports to see exactly how much time was spent on high-priority issues. FAQ # What happens if I don\u2019t set any fields as required? # If you don\u2019t set any fields as required, users can submit time entries without completing critical information like the project, task, or description. While this won\u2019t prevent users from adding time entries, it can lead to incomplete or inconsistent data, making reporting and analysis more difficult. Can I make a custom field visible only for specific projects? # Yes, custom fields can be set to be visible only for specific projects. In Project settings , you can manage which custom fields should be visible and set default values for each project. Additionally, you can choose to make some fields visible only when a user selects a specific project. Can I make certain fields invisible to regular users? # Yes, you can make certain fields invisible to regular users while still allowing them to track the data. Invisible fields can be used for metadata, project IDs, or backend integrations. Users won\u2019t see these fields in their Time Tracker or Timesheet, but the data will still be available for reporting and can be used in exports or API integrations. Can required fields be used in reports? # Yes, required fields can be used in reports . When you export time entries to Excel or CSV, the required fields (and their values) will appear in the Detailed report . This allows you to filter and analyze time entries based on those required fields, ensuring you have consistent and complete data for reporting purposes. Was this article helpful?

More information on how to Forecast project completion Project budget chart # Forecasting budget chart shows project expenses based on the estimated budget allocated to that project. Budget forecasting supports budget estimates using scheduled assignments, time entries, and expenses. The chart reflects either the set budget or the highest value reached if the budget is exceeded. If no data is available for the project (e.g. time entries, expenses, estimates), the forecasting chart will be empty. Legend # Chart legend is located at the top-right corner of the page. The chart displays three lines: Completed (solid blue line) Represents the total budget spent up to the present day. The completed line is not displayed for future periods. Forecasted (dotted blue line) Represents the prediction of the project\u2019s progress based on realized and scheduled data. It starts with Today and changes its look once it becomes a budget. Budget (solid dark gray line) Static, horizontal line that represents the budget set per project. Each line represents a continuous trend from the first to the last data point. Lines show both ascending and descending trends with cumulative values. If a budget reset is configured, the line will be color-coded to indicate whether the estimate has been exceeded (e.g. the line turns red if the budget is exceeded). Budget reset # If a budget reset is enabled, the estimates will adjust accordingly: weekly, monthly, or yearly, each indicating the project will be under/over/on budget by Y [currency] for the respective time period. Possible scenarios # 1. Project budget hasn\u2019t reached estimated value Forecast curve hasn\u2019t reached the budget line, meaning the last point shows a remaining value greater than zero. Currently, the project is expected to come in under budget by Y [currency]. 2. Project budget reached estimated value Forecasted curve has reached the budget line and the last point shows a value equal to zero. The project is within the estimated budget range expressed in Y [currency]. 3. Project budget is over estimated value The forecast curve has exceeded the budget line, showing a remaining value less than zero.

When the project\u2019s budget is exceeded, the forecasted line will continue beyond the estimated budget line, reflecting continued expenses. For example: If the budget for the initial months of the year was $5,000 and $150 was spent, the budget line will be positioned on the chart according to its value relative to the Y axis.

Clockify provides various reports that allow you to view your employees\u2019 time entries in different ways, from summarized overviews to detailed breakdowns. This guide will walk you through the different types of reports, how to filter and customize them, and how to monitor your team\u2019s tracked time. Access permissions # Team managers # Access to billable and non-billable entries Can view the total time tracked by team members Can export reports as PDF , CSV , or Excel Can share reports , but cannot schedule reports to be emailed Can enable or disable rounding of time entries Project managers # Access to billable and non-billable entries for their assigned projects Can view the total time tracked by users working on their projects Can export reports as PDF , CSV , or Excel Can share reports , but cannot schedule reports to be emailed Can enable or disable rounding of time entries Key features & permissions # Reports in Clockify include the Summary , Detailed , and Weekly reports , each offering different ways to group and display your team\u2019s time entries You can export reports in PDF , Excel , or CSV formats Team managers can access both billable and non-billable entries , and generate reports, but cannot schedule reports to be mailed Project managers have similar report access but can only see the time entries associated with their projects You can also track employee activity , set time targets , and monitor whether employees meet their weekly or monthly time quotas Types of reports # Summary report # The Summary report is highly flexible and allows you to group your team\u2019s time entries in various ways to match your reporting needs. You can group data by: Project Client User Group Tag Month Week Date How to use: Common scenario : To get an overview of your team\u2019s hours by user and project, select User as the main grouping and Project as a subgroup. You can further subgroup by Task if needed. This will give you a detailed breakdown of the time tracked by each team member for specific tasks within projects. By date : Another useful way to view hours is by grouping by Date , which will show you the total hours each employee tracked per day. This is ideal if you need to see a bi-weekly or monthly report for your team, and the Weekly report doesn\u2019t suit your needs. Three levels of grouping : The Summary report supports up to three levels of grouping, providing a more granular view of your data. You can customize the date range to meet your specific reporting needs. Weekly report # The Weekly report is designed for weekly tracking of hours worked. You can group the data by User or Project . How to use: Set date range : This report shows data for a fixed weekly range (one week at a time). You cannot change the date range to show more than one week, but the Summary Report can be used to view multiple weeks or any custom date range. Perfect for weekly overviews : If you\u2019re monitoring your team\u2019s work on a week-to-week basis, this is a great report for that. Detailed report # The Detailed report provides a comprehensive breakdown of time entries, showing each entry individually without any grouping or summarization. How to use: Use this report to see all the details of your team\u2019s time entries . An Admin can also edit entries in this report. The Detailed Report can be exported in CSV , allowing you to create custom reports or further process the data in tools like Excel or Google Sheets. Filter reports by individual employees # If you need data for a single employee, you can use filters to narrow the report to only show that employee\u2019s hours. Steps to filter: Go to the Report page (Summary, Detailed, or Weekly) Apply filters : Use the filter options to select the specific employee or group of employees View data : The report will now only show the time entries for the selected employee(s) Customize reports # If the built-in Clockify reports don\u2019t meet your exact needs, you can customize your reports by exporting the Detailed Report as CSV and using tools like Excel or Google Sheets to create your own custom reports. In Excel or Google Sheets, you can create pivot tables to rearrange the data into the structure you need. This flexibility allows you to adjust reports to fit different team structures or project needs. Timesheet view # If you\u2019re on a paid subscription plan , you can also access employee Timesheets directly, which is similar to the Weekly report but with more customization options. Filter timesheets by a specific employee and group by Project for detailed tracking of time Export timesheets to PDF or Excel for record-keeping or reporting To export use your browser\u2019s Print option (Ctrl/Cmd + P) to Save as PDF if you need to save a copy of the Timesheet. Monitoring active work and tracked time # You can keep track of the current work being done by your team members through the Team dashboard . Steps to monitor active work: Go to the Team dashboard View last activity with all active timers You can filter reports by date range to see who has not tracked time in a given period Sort the Total tracked column in ascending order to identify users with no time tracked.

What to do: Make sure the team member is tracking time in the correct workspace (especially if they\u2019ve created a personal workspace during sign-up). If they mistakenly tracked time in their personal workspace, you will need to check that workspace as well. FAQ # How can I get a report of my team\u2019s hours by project? # You can use the Summary report , group it by User , and subgroup by Project . This will give you a breakdown of hours worked by each team member per project. Can I get a weekly overview of my team\u2019s time? # Yes, use the Weekly report to track your team\u2019s hours on a week-by-week basis. You can group it by User or Project for more detailed insights. What if I need a custom report structure? # If the built-in reports don\u2019t fit your needs, you can export the Detailed report as a CSV and use pivot tables in Excel or Google sheets to create a custom structure. How can I see if a team member hasn\u2019t tracked time? # Go to the Weekly report , group it by User , and click Show users without time . Alternatively, you can use the Team dashboard to filter users by date range and check if any have tracked no time. What should I do if an employee\u2019s time isn\u2019t showing up in my reports? # If time is missing, check if the employee has tracked time in the correct workspace.

Clockify has different types of reports that help you stay on top of your team\u2019s work hours and expenses. This guide will walk you through how to use these reports, customize them, and export them for deeper analysis. Access permissions # Who can\u2026 View & export all reports Manage all reports Edit time entries Workspace admin/owner \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 Team manager X* X X Regular user X** X X * Team Manager can view reports for their team, but does not have permission to manage reports for the entire workspace. ** Regular User can only view their own time entries in reports. Types of reports in Clockify # Clockify provides three main types of reports, each serving different purposes based on how you want to analyze your team\u2019s work: Summary report # The Summary report is highly flexible and allows you to group your team\u2019s time entries in various ways, depending on your needs. You can group data by: Project Client User Group Tag Month, Week, or Date How to use the Summary report : Group by User : Get a breakdown of your employees\u2019 hours by user, project, and task. This view helps you see how much time each team member spent on specific projects or tasks. Group by Date : See how many hours each employee tracked on a specific day. This is ideal if you need a daily, bi-weekly, or monthly report. You can select any date range at the top right corner of the report to get a custom view of your team\u2019s hours. Weekly report # The Weekly report focuses on the hours tracked within a set week. It\u2019s helpful for weekly tracking and approval workflows. How to use the Weekly report: Group by User or Project : You can view hours based on individual users or specific projects. The report always shows data for one week at a time. However, if you want to see more than one week, you can use the Summary report and group by User and Date to see hours per day across weeks. Detailed report # The Detailed report provides a line-by-line view of all time entries for your team, without any grouping or summarization. This report is best for viewing all tracked time in detail and for making adjustments to time entries. How to use the Detailed report : See every time entry recorded by your team Admins can edit team members\u2019 time entries directly from the Detailed report This report can be exported in various formats, such as PDF, Excel, or CSV Manage individual employee reports # If you need to get data for a single employee, you can filter reports by user to generate a report specific to that individual\u2019s hours. Steps to generate an individual employee report: Open the Summary report , Detailed report , or Weekly report Apply the user filter to select a specific employee View the report for that employee\u2019s hours, and export or analyze the data as needed Customize reports # Clockify\u2019s built-in reports are flexible, but if you need even more customization, you can export the Detailed report and create customized reports using tools like pivot tables in Excel or Google Sheets. To customize reports: Export the Detailed report in CSV format Open the file in Excel or Google sheets Use pivot tables or other analysis tools to organize the data in the exact format you need This is particularly useful if you want to create more complex reports or need to combine data from different sources. View and manage Timesheets # If your workspace is on a paid plan, you can access Timesheets for your employees. This feature provides a summary of each team member\u2019s hours, similar to the Weekly report but in a more structured format. To access and manage Timesheets: Go to the Timesheet page Use filters to select a specific employee and group the timesheet by Project You can export the timesheet as a PDF for easy printing or saving Current work and tracked time # You can monitor your team\u2019s real-time activities and check for any discrepancies in tracked time through the Dashboard . To view active timers: Navigate to the Team dashboard In the Last activity section, you\u2019ll see the active timers of all employees You can also see who hasn\u2019t tracked time for a specific date range by filtering the Total tracked column This is a great way to quickly spot whether team members are meeting their weekly or monthly time goals. Notify employees of time tracking issues # Clockify offers automatic reminders for team members who are under or over their time targets. Set reminders for employees: Set time tracking targets (e.g. 8 hours per day) If someone forgets to log their time, Clockify will send an email reminder If an employee exceeds their time target, you, as an Admin, will receive an email notification about the overage Troubleshooting # Sometimes, employees may report tracking time that doesn\u2019t appear in your reports. This is typically caused by them tracking time in a different workspace (such as their personal workspace). Make sure that employees are tracking their time in the correct workspace. When users create a Clockify account, they are given a personal workspace by default. If they\u2019re working on a team project, they should track time in the workspace you\u2019ve invited them to.

With GPS tracking, you can see who\u2019s currently working on site and everyone\u2019s location history throughout the day while they were on the clock. GPS tracking is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Data gathering and privacy # Location can\u2019t be tracked without user\u2019s knowledge and permission. In order to record the location: Admin has to enable Activate GPS tracking in workspace settings. All workspace members will get a notification when location recording is enabled via a web and a mobile notification User has to download and track time via the mobile app (iOS or Android). User has to enable Location services on their mobile phone. User has to allow the Clockify app to access their location. Each regular user can see all their recorded locations. Admin sees all recorded locations in the workspace. Location is recorded every time timer is started and stopped in the mobile app . Also, while the timer is running, more locations will be recorded if the user moves significantly (usually more than 500m) \u2013 this varies depending on your device (its operating system, version, settings, and granted permissions). Locations are collected even if the mobile app works in the background. Each location is tied to a time entry. If the time entry is deleted, its locations are deleted, as well. Along with that, if you undo the \u2018delete\u2019 action , entry\u2019s location will be restored as well. Admins can delete anyone\u2019s location. Regular users can delete their own location.

View location # To view recorded locations, click on Activity in the sidebar, and then the Locations tab. Admins can view everyone\u2019s recorded location, while regular users can see only their own. You can see current locations of your staff, their routes, and time stamps of when the location was recorded. On the right side, you can see all active users in your workspace, plus their last recorded location on the map for that day as well as the timestamp when it was recorded. If a user doesn\u2019t have any location that day, you\u2019ll see just a hyphen (-). If a user has a red recording dot next to them, it means they still have the timer running at that location. To see a user\u2019s all recorded locations in the day, click on them in the sidebar.

To see locations for other days, click on < or > in the upper right corner next to the date (you can go back up to past 7 days). Delete location # Both admins and regular users can delete recorded locations. You can delete recorded locations on the web version of Clockify, when you go to Activity > Locations from the sidebar.

If you\u2019re a regular user, just hover over the record you wish to delete and click on the trash icon. All locations older than 7 days are deleted forever automatically.

Clockify\u2019s import wizard is designed to guide you through the process and help you catch errors before you finalize the import. Import data and permissions # Data User role Subscription plan Projects, clients, tasks, tags owner/admin Any plan Timesheets owner/admin Paid plans only User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. The maximum file size for any CSV file is 10MB. Format your data # To make sure that the import is completed successfully, your CSV data need to match the format required by Clockify. The easiest way to format your data correctly is by downloading our pre-made templates for Timesheets , Projects and Clients directly from the Import page. You also need to make sure that your CSV file contains all the required columns for your workspace and that the column headers are named correctly. Start import # To start the import process: Go to the Settings and choose the Import tab Drag & drop a CSV file, or upload it from your computer Import wizard # The import wizard guides you through two import steps that leave your data clean and accurate. Step 1: Inspect data # After you upload your file, a preview will appear. Here, you can review the data and correct any issues before you proceed. Error detection The wizard automatically highlights rows and errors. Use the Only show rows with errors option to quickly filter the list and see what needs to be fixed. Fix errors & reupload Clockify automatically detects common delimiters (commas and semicolons). If a column name is not recognized, it will be marked with a warning and that data won\u2019t be imported. If you find errors you need to fix, you can make changes to your file outside Clockify and reupload it directly from this step. Timesheet-specific checks If you are importing Timesheet data, the wizard will ask you to confirm the date format used in your file. You will also be notified if you are importing Timesheet data for users who are not yet in your workspace, allowing you to add them first. Step 2: Import summary # Once you\u2019ve reviewed your data and clicked Import , the progress bar will show the import status. The import will continue in the background if you leave the page. When it\u2019s complete, a summary will be displayed with a link to your newly-imported data in Clockify. Check time and date formats The formats used in your CSV file must exactly match the formats set in your Clockify account. Format Where to check settings Mismatch example Time (12-hour / 24-hour) Profile Settings If your CSV has 1:00 PM, but your settings use 24-hour time, the import will fail. Duration (hh:mm:ss, etc.) Workspace Settings Your CSV duration format (e.g. 1:30) doesn\u2019t match the format set in your workspace. Date (DD/MM/YYYY, etc.) Profile Settings Your CSV date format doesn\u2019t match the one set in your profile.

This way, your whole team can track time. In order to do that, they first need to be invited to your workspace . For step-by-step guidance on how to invite and manage users in Clockify, watch the video and follow the instructions below. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Only owners and admins can invite new users to a workspace and manage their details (set their billable rate, set as inactive, and assign to groups). Invite users # To invite users to your workspace: Click Team in the main sidebar on the left Click on Add new member / Add full member (if kiosk is activated) in the upper right corner Enter the email of the person you want to invite Click Send invite If you\u2019d like to invite multiple users at once, enter the emails in the designated fields one below the other, or copy and paste the list of emails (e.g. mark@domain.com, jane@domain.com). If you\u2019re using a free plan you can enter up to 5 email addresses at the same time (but you can invite an unlimited number of users in total). If you\u2019re on a paid plan , there\u2019s no limit to the number of email addresses you can enter and thus the number of users you can invite at once. Keep in mind that paid plans are charged per user seat . Learn more about how to manage user seats and paid plans here . Invite users manually # If you\u2019ve added a member, but they haven\u2019t received an email, you can send them the invitation manually: Click on three dots next to member and choose Send an invite email Members can sign up on their own and they\u2019ll automatically be part of your workspace (if they have a pending invite). If a member already has a Clockify account, they have to log in and accept the invite via the bell notification in the upper right corner. If you\u2019d like to revoke user invite , you can do that from the Members page in your CAKE.com Account. Accept invite # The person you invited will receive an invitation email with the activation link they need to click After clicking the link, they need to verify their email The invited person can then log in and start tracking time for you If someone is invited to your workspace and doesn\u2019t have a Clockify account, they can sign up and automatically join your workspace (if they have a pending invite). As a result, their CAKE.com Account will also be created. If the user is already invited, they won\u2019t be able to create an account with the same email address on the Signup page. If a person already has a Clockify account , they will receive an email and a notification in Clockify. In that case, they have to open the bell notification from the top right corner and click Accept . Then, they\u2019ll be able to switch to your workspace and start tracking time for your company. Filter users # The Team page allows you to have a better overview of your team members and their tracking data. Quickly find specific users and apply filters to narrow down your team list and customize the table columns to display the most relevant information for your needs. To filter out users in your workspace: On the Team page , look for the filter bar at the top of the member table Click to open the filter options and select the criteria you want to use (e.g. role, group, week start\u2026) Choose the specific values for each filter you\u2019ve selected Click Apply filter to update the table with your filtered results Clear filters to reset your view. Regular users , Team managers , or Project managers can filter users in both the Full and Limited tabs based on the information you have permission to view in the table. Admins and Owners have broader filtering permissions to filter users in both the Full and Limited tabs by all their information, except for user custom fields. Customize your table view # As an Owner or Admin , you can personalize your Team table: Add/Remove filters: Adjust which filters appear in your filter bar Select/Deselect Columns: Choose which columns are visible in the table Sort Columns: Sort data by most columns that contain single values (e.g. Billable rate, Cost rate, Role, Week start, Daily working capacity) If Billable or Cost rates are turned off in your workspace and then enabled, they\u2019ll automatically be selected in the filter picker for easy access. Edit user profile # Apart from editing user profile with the Control accounts , you can also do it on the Team page. Make all sorts of modifications of your team members\u2019 profiles including week start, working days and daily work capacity. Owner and admin can\u2019t change user\u2019s email, profile picture and username. To edit user profile: Go to Team page Click three dots next to the person whose profile you\u2019d like to edit Make changes: User\u2019s week start Define working days User\u2019s daily work capacity If you have permission to edit user data in the Edit profile window, you can also edit that same data directly in the table, if the corresponding column is visible in your view.

This allows the Team Manager to oversee that user\u2019s time and attendance. Assign to groups # As an Admin/Owner, assign or remove Team managers from groups in the Group tab. The Assigned team manager field is available on the Team page for Standard plan users and higher. If your subscription downgrades to a Basic or Free plan, this field will no longer be visible. Deactivate and delete user # When you deactivate a user, they won\u2019t be able to see and track time on your workspace and won\u2019t appear on the Team page anymore. The difference between deleting and deactivating is that you can activate a user whenever you want, without them having to accept workspace invitation. To deactivate a user: Go to Team page Click three dots next to the person you want to deactivate/delete Select Deactivate Once the user is no longer active, you will be able to delete them. To delete a user: Open your Profile settings Choose Manage CAKE.com Account You\u2019ll be redirected to your CAKE.com organization account where you can make the changes For more information on how to delete a user, check out this article in the CAKE.com Help center. Important to note # If user is deactivated from the only workspace they were using, they\u2019ll be logged out and redirected to the login page to make another workspace. In case they are using more than one workspace, they\u2019ll be able to log in to the other workspace they\u2019re a member of. Users can only be deleted once they are deactivated. Also, when a user is deactivated, their current timer is stopped (if they have one running). The time entries of deleted/inactive users will remain but you won\u2019t be able to filter reports by them. You can see their time in the summary report when you group it by user. Additionally, the time off data of deleted users is permanently lost, even if they are reinstated. Reactivate user # To reactivate a user: Go to Team page Select Show all or Show inactive users in the drop down menu Select Activate Once a user is activated, they can log in and track time as usual (although they won\u2019t receive an email or a notification that they\u2019ve been activated).

Here\u2019s how to find and fix the issue. Non-billable time entries won\u2019t appear on invoices # Clockify invoices only include billable time entries. If your entries were tracked as non-billable, they won\u2019t be available for import into the invoice at all. The invoice will appear empty.

So even if you\u2019ve set a project or workspace rate, a blank $0 project member or a task rate can silently override it, resulting in an empty invoice or a $0 total. Rate hierarchy from lowest to highest: Workspace rate Project rate Team rate Task rate Project member rate What to do: Start by checking for any blank or 0$ rates at the top of the hierarchy (Task or Project Member), and work your way down.

Customize your sessions You can set up the Pomodoro timer settings to match your preferences. Set intervals for your focus and break sessions Turn on Automatic breaks to start a break timer as soon as your work session ends Choose a default project for your Pomodoro breaks Notifications You\u2019ll receive push notifications when it\u2019s time to start or end a session, so you don\u2019t have to constantly watch the app. You can even start a break directly from the notification by tapping Start break .

Tracking time on a Child issue in JIRA will be picked up as a task in Clockify with a tag Subtask . Tags \u2013 correspond to issue types (bug/task/story) and labels in JIRA. You can add more tags to your time entry directly from JIRA. Information about an Epic or a Sprint will not be recorded, however, if you track time directly on an Epic in JIRA it will create a time entry in Clockify with a tag Epic . In order for the integration to pick up the right project/task/tag, it either has to already exist in Clockify, or you need to set the right permissions in Clockify\u2019s Workspace settings and make sure all users can create new projects/tasks/tags. Work log # When you stop the timer, the entry will be saved in Clockify and a time log will be created in the JIRA work log (time spent field). Work log shows a timeline of each time entry recorded by everyone for that issue.

Likewise, if you edit/delete a time entry in Clockify, it will not be reflected in JIRA. Only time entries stopped in JIRA issues are going to be added to the work log.

On the other hand, users that have an email and can log into Clockify on their own are considered full users. You can use limited members to: Add historical time data for people who are no longer in the company Allow employees without an email to clock in and clock out via shared kiosk Full vs limited member # Full member Limited member Has name and email Has only name Can log into Clockify and use apps (web, mobile, desktop) Can use only kiosk Can switch tasks and projects, and record location Limited by kiosk Takes up a full seat (from $3.99/seat) Takes up a limited seat (from $0.79/seat) Creating limited members # Make sure you have kiosk enabled in workspace settings Go to the Team page in the sidebar Choose the Limited tab Click Add limited members Enter Employee name (one employee per line) Click Add If you\u2019re on a FREE plan, you can have an unlimited number of limited members.

Each active limited member requires one limited seat and the price depends on your current plan. You can buy limited seats on your Subscription page, or directly when adding a member on the Team page. Added limited members are immediately active upon being added. If you deactivate a limited user, another limited user can take their limited seat. If user edits their email address in any way, Clockify will treat it as a new email for a new account.

Once you lock timesheets, you can safely send your reports to your clients or accountant knowing the data will stay accurate. Lock timesheets is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard , Pro , or Enterprise plan. Steps to lock timesheets # Navigate to the workspace name Open menu Choose Workspace settings from the dropdown Switch to the Permissions tab Toggle Lock entries switch to activate Specify a date before which all time entries will be locked Changes will be automatically saved upon selecting the date or toggling the Lock entries switch When entries are locked before, for example, April 15th, it means that regular users won\u2019t be able to: Edit any time entries with the date April 14th or earlier Add new time entries with the date April 14th or earlier Locking timesheets doesn\u2019t affect administrators. Admins can still edit and add time in the locked period. To unlock, move the switch back, and everyone will be able to edit all their time entries and add new ones to any date they want. If you lock timesheets each month and have users across timezones, you should set the lock to the 2nd of each month. If you set it to 1st of the month, your team that\u2019s in the later timezone won\u2019t be able to enter dates for the last day in the previous month due to timezone difference. Automatic lock # Set automatic lock and the lock date will get auto-updated each day, week, or month so you don\u2019t have to do it manually anymore. How to\u00a0set automatic lock # Open the menu next to the workspace name Go to workspace settings and switch to the Permissions tab Switch Automatically update lock date to ON Select lock frequency (weekly, monthly, older than x days/weeks/months) When selecting the Weekly option, you have to select two days: when the lock date gets updated (e.g. Wednesday) and the first day of the week in your company (e.g. Monday).\u00a0 This way, when a new week starts (on Monday), your team can still add their missing hours for the previous week before that week gets locked (which happens on Wednesday). When the automatic lock is enabled, you won\u2019t be able to manually set a lock date. When you set auto-update lock date older than 1 day , it means that at every end of the day, the lock date will be automatically updated so users cannot edit their yesterday\u2019s hours. The daily lock is updated every day at midnight, using the workspace owner\u2019s time zone. If you lock timesheets monthly and have users across timezones, you should set auto-lock to the 2nd of each month \u2013 otherwise, your team that\u2019s in the later timezone won\u2019t be able to enter dates for the last day in the month. Lock today\u2019s time # You can\u2019t lock current or future dates. To prevent people from adding time manually for today or the future (or changing the start/end time of their entries), you need to enable the Force timer . Lock expenses # If you\u2019re using expenses, keep in mind that lock date also affects expenses, meaning regular users won\u2019t be able to add or edit expenses for locked dates.

The list is organized by days, and each day contains the time entries you\u2019ve made that day. Each time entry shows the project, description, duration with tags and billability status (if any). Duration format on the Mac desktop app depends on the duration format set in the Clockify workspace settings on the web version. For example, if you set the duration format to decimal on the web (e.g. 4.00), the desktop app will display the duration of tracker time in the same format, as well. Auto tracker # In the Auto tracker, you can see a list of detected programs, descriptions of visited websites or open documents, activity start and end times, total duration, and percentage of idle time. Track your time across programs to generate timesheets based on your activity.

So projects, tasks, and tags are available for selection if they were loaded before you went offline. It\u2019s not possible to create new projects, tasks, tags, and clients while offline. The app stores data locally, and syncs with the web version once you\u2019re online again. If you want, you can also perform a manual sync by clicking the refresh icon.

Each user submits their tracked time entries and expenses for various marketing campaigns and projects. As the manager, you review these submissions to verify the accuracy of tracked hours and expenses, to make sure that they align with project budgets and client agreements.

Managing tracked expenses is available on PRO and higher subscription plans and can be performed by workspace Admins and Team managers.

In that case, the manager will be able to approve or reject only the newly added time (previously approved time remains).

In this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the process of managing subscriptions, upgrading or downgrading plans, and understanding billing cycles and user seats. Key concepts # Before diving into subscription management, it\u2019s important to get familiar with some key concepts: User seats : Each active user in your workspace occupies a \u201cseat.\u201d You\u2019re charged based on the number of active seats in your workspace, regardless of the user\u2019s role or features Bundle seats : If you\u2019re subscribed to the CAKE.com Productivity Suite , you may have additional bundle seats across different apps (Clockify, Pumble, Plaky) Full & limited users : Full users : Team members with complete access to the workspace Limited users : Team members with restricted access, mainly for clocking in and out. These users may be charged with some additional fees.

User account overview # In your Marketplace profile, you can access your basic data and view a comprehensive list of installed add-ons. These add-ons are categorized based on the product and the workspace they were installed in. General tab # Each profile contains some general info in the General tab: It\u2019s accessible to all signed-in users, but with certain information is visible only to users with an admin role. It includes: Profile photo : Taken from the first product account used to sign in to the Marketplace. You can modify it in the profile settings of your Clockify product account. Name : The name you registered your first product account with, also unchangeable from the Marketplace. Email : The email you registered your first product account with, also unchangeable from the Marketplace. Marketplace account button : Leads to the Manage accounts page. Log out : Click here to log out. It\u2019ll redirect you to the Marketplace landing page . If you are an admin and have at least one workspace with at least one installed add-on, you\u2019ll see a list of installed add-ons with the details: Add-on name Date of update Date of installation: In case of reinstallation, the last date is shown Who installed Add-on status Date of deactivation (if there is any) Add-ons listed here are sorted in the descending order based on their installation details. Unlisted add-ons are also visible in the list. Please note that you can access unlisted add-ons directly from your Clockify profile, or through the direct link. However, the access is limited to workspaces where the add-on was initially installed. Add-on status # Add-on status indicates the status of the add-on in the payment and installation process. It can be: Deactivated : Add-on has been deactivated Installed : Add-on has been installed successfully Overdue : After the subscription runs out, the installed add-on is marked as Overdue Payment failed : Payment process failed and add-on cannot be used Uninstalled : Add-on is unistalled Customer & Payment information tab # Customer & payment information tab visible only to workspace admins that have installed paid add-on at one point in time Invoices # Invoices tab appears when invoices are available on Stripe .

This can be useful if you, for example, want to access the Marketplace with more than one account, but don\u2019t want to be signing in and out of the Marketplace and Clockify all the time (multiple times). This way you\u2019ll have an overview of all the add-ons installed across your multiple accounts and products. If you click Log in with Clockify and are already logged in to your Marketplace account, you\u2019ll be automatically redirected to this (Manage accounts) page with a message confirming that the account has already been created. If one of the products has both regional (or global) and subdomain accounts, they will be split into two accounts in the table. The Manage accounts table will display this as two separate accounts, each connected to a different URL. Verify account # If your account needs to be verified, you\u2019ll be redirected to the Clockify login page where you\u2019ll be prompted to verify your account. Delete Marketplace account # If you click Delete account , a new page with account deletion details appears requiring you to confirm the action. Account deletion occurs automatically when all associated products are deleted, since there is no way to sign in without them.

Alerts are not sent immediately # Estimate alerts are sent approximately 30 minutes after the threshold is reached, meaning that if your estimate is set to trigger at 80%, an alert won\u2019t appear instantly. It will typically be delivered via email within 30-40 minutes. Alerts are only sent once per threshold # Clockify sends a single alert when the estimate threshold is reached, for example, 80% or 100%. If your tracked time jumps rapidly past multiple thresholds, you\u2019ll only receive the alert for the highest one reached, not for the lower thresholds passed. Workspace alert rules may be misconfigured # Admins define who receives alerts and when they are sent. If no alert rules exist or the wrong group is selected, notifications won\u2019t go out. How to check (Admins): Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name Select \u201cWorkspace settings\u201d Navigate to the Alerts tab Review the rules and confirm which group is selected: Admins Project Managers Project Members You can define multiple rules that include all groups by clicking on the \u201cAdd\u201d button. Your role doesn\u2019t match the alert rule # Even if you are a part of the workspace, you won\u2019t receive alerts unless your role matches the selected rule. Examples: If the rule says Project managers, you must be assigned as a project manager on that project. If the rule says Project members, you must be added to the project access list. How to verify: For Project Managers: Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar Check the list of projects for that specific project Clockify only shows you the projects you are officially assigned to manage. For regular users (verified by Admins or Project Managers) Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar Click on the project to open it Go to the Access tab Check if the team member in question is listed under the \u201cMembers\u201d section Your personal email preferences may be disabled # Even if the alert rules are correct, you won\u2019t receive alerts if you\u2019ve disabled them in your email preferences.

Clockify multiplies each billable time entry with their corresponding hourly rate and that number is shown as earning in a report. In order for Clockify to calculate hourly rates, you first have to mark time entries as billable in the Time Tracker (or in the Detailed report) by clicking on the $ sign. If you don\u2019t use hourly rates, you can completely remove all the billable information from interface for everyone by turning off Activate billable hours in Workspace Settings > Permissions tab, or you can hide it just for regular users. Hourly rate types # There are several types of hourly rates in Clockify: Workspace rate , which you define in Workspace settings; it gets applied to all billable time rates unless it gets overridden by a more specific billable rate Member rate , which you define on Team page for each user Project rate , which you define for each project Task rate , if enabled in workspace settings Projects\u2019 member rate , which you define in projects\u2019 Access tab In addition to billable rates, you can also have one more set of rates for labor cost . Hourly rate hierarchy # Project\u2019s member rate > Task rate > Project rate > Member rate > Workspace rate Applied billable rate # A more specific billable rate overrides a less specific one: Project\u2019s member rate > Task rate > Project rate > Member rate > Workspace rate . For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a freelancer and you have a default rate you charge on all projects. You define that rate as your workspace billable rate. Then, you also have a client to whom you charge a different rate. In that case, you can create a project, assign it to the client, and set the desired hourly rate for that project. To set different pricing per client at project level: Create different projects Assign them to respective clients Go to Projects and click the project name Click Settings tab Set the desired billable rate for each project in Project billable rate section You can\u2019t assign a custom billable rate for a specific time entry. But, you can use a tag to indicate a special billable rate so you know how much to charge when preparing an invoice. Set custom currency # To change currency, click on Settings in the left sidebar then when in the Workspace settings type your currency instead of USD. You can add multiple currencies on a workspace, or assign different currencies to multiple clients . Currency can only be edited by the workspace administrator and it\u2019s applied to the whole account (including billable rates). Who can set hourly rates # Only workspace admin can set hourly rates for workspace, user, and project. Project managers can set hourly rates for people on their projects if Who can see billable rates in workspace settings is set to everyone. Regular members can\u2019t set or edit any hourly rates. For more info, check out the Understanding user roles & access permissions article. Share additional data with employees # If you wish your employees to see their earnings and hourly rates, but don\u2019t wish them to see other people\u2019s rates or want to limit them to seeing just cost rates, you can create a shared report: Open Summary or Detailed report Filter by employee Choose if you wish to display amount, cost, or profit Click on share icon Name the report and set it to private Choose who can view the report Your employee can now access the report you\u2019ve created Project and task billability # You can change whether time entries on a project are billable or non-billable by default. You can set project\u2019s default billability status when you click on a project from the Projects page and go to the Project Settings tab. If you set the project as billable, when someone tracks time and doesn\u2019t specify billability, the time entry will be marked as billable (which you can edit later). It\u2019s possible to change the billable status the same way you set it, in the Project Settings tab. Once the project\u2019s billable status is changed e.g. from billable to non-billable this will not affect previously created time entries. Their status will remain the same as it was when it was created. However, all new time entries linked to that project will automatically be set to the new status, in this case, non-billable. If you have some tasks on project that are billable and some non-billable, you can choose their billable status by enabling task rates in workspace settings. Who can see and change billable status of entries # You can set permissions so that only admins see billable status of time entries. This way, regular users won\u2019t be able to see the currency symbol at all, and therefore, change the billable status of entries.

Clockify extension can also create and select projects, tasks, and tags based on the integration: If there\u2019s a project or task with the same name in Clockify, it will be selected If there\u2019s no project or task and you have the permission to create it (based on workspace settings), a new one will be automatically created and selected To enable creation of projects/tasks/tags, you first need to enable it in the extension\u2019s Settings. Each integration is different. For example, task and project can be created from Asana, Gitlab will also pick up tags, but Gmail won\u2019t do anything except pick up description. If you need support for this in other integrations, feel free to contribute code to the extension on Github . Custom domains # If you use a self-hosted tool that you use on a custom URL (e.g. you use YouTrack on mydomain.com), you\u2019ll need to add your domain and connect it to the corresponding tool: Open extension Open settings (hamburger menu in the upper left corner) Click Integrations Scroll down and under Custom domains enter your domain (e.g. mydomain.com) Select the tool that\u2019s on that domain Click Add Disable integrations # If you don\u2019t want the button to appear in certain web apps, you can disable it in Integrations . Open the extension Click on the menu icon in the upper right corner Click on the Integrations button and you\u2019ll jump to the integrations list Uncheck the apps in which you don\u2019t want to see the Start timer button If you use a self-hosted / on-premise version of some app (like JIRA or Gitlab), at the bottom of the Integrations page you can specify the domain where you have the app installed.

FAQ # I get an error about missing project when I try to stop the timer # If you have Timesheet enabled, project is automatically a required field . To stop the timer, you\u2019ll have to open your timer and select a project. Tip: You can set a default project, so each time you start a timer, project is selected automatically (you can enable it by opening the extension and going to Settings). I\u2019m using an on-premise version of some app # No problem. In the extension options, select Integrations , scroll down to the bottom, select the tool you\u2019re using (e.g. Gitlab), and enter your custom domain. Help, I don\u2019t see the button # If you don\u2019t see the button, first make sure you\u2019re logged in to the extension. If that doesn\u2019t help, restart the browser.

You\u2019ll be guided through the flow of the successful payment and also get some tips on what to do if the payment fails. When you subscribe to a paid plan on Clockify for the first time, you need to complete the following steps: Once you logged in, click the Upgrade button at the top right corner of the page You\u2019ll jump to the Plans tab in the Subscription page Choose the plan you\u2019d like to subscribe to and the billing cycle (monthly/annually) You\u2019ll see the three steps you need to complete to activate your subscription Step 1 Customer info # In the first step, you need to provide some basic information about you or the organization you represent. In the Customer type field, choose if you\u2019d like to be registered as: Individual or Company / Organization Individual implies that you, as a self-employed or freelance individual, are subscribing to the app. When filling out the information, country and company names are optional. Billing and usage details associated with the subscription are linked to you as an individual. This is suitable if an individual user is using Clockify as a productivity tool. Selecting for Company / Organization indicates that the subscription is intended for a group, company, or collective entity. The billing and subscription details are tied to the organization\u2019s name. This is useful when Clockify is used as a productivity tool for a team or business, allowing teams within one organization to access and use the app under a single subscription. Keep in mind that when you opt for a Company/Organization as a Customer type for the first time, or switch from Individual to Company/Organization Customer type , you need to choose the Country (required) you/your organization is based in. Tax policy of the country you choose here will determine the specific fields you\u2019ll see in Step 2 . In case you\u2019d like to switch from individual to company/organization , you have the option to add the info related to your company. If you had set Customer type as Company / Organization in Step 1 , you cannot switch to Individual after you subscribe. However, you can switch from Individual to Company / Organization Customer type. The State/Province field may be required based on your selected country. Only workspace owner can edit information provided in this step. Step 2 Invoice info # Here you should provide us with more details including email and additional details needed to properly invoice subscription payments. The form differs based on the customer type you previously chose. Individual : Email City Postal code Individual customer type Company/organization : Company name Email Address (if required*) *Address in the Invoice info tab is required for Individual and Company/Organization customer types based in the US only. All prices are shown exclusive of taxes. If VAT applies based on your country\u2019s regulations, it will be added to the final price, which you can review at checkout before completing your payment. Example of how tax is added to the subscription fee: Consider a scenario where a company located in the United Kingdom (UK) subscribes to Clockify. Since the UK applies tax to digital services, the subscription fee will include this tax. Now, let\u2019s assume that their monthly subscription fee is $50. When the company proceeds to pay, they will be charged an additional 20% for tax, making the total amount $60 ($50 for subscription fee + $10 for the tax) . In specific cases when the Customer type is Company/Organization with the Country with multiple tax types, you\u2019ll get Tax type and Tax ID fields that you need to fill out. After you\u2019ve filled out all the necessary information, click Next step and proceed to Step 3. Only workspace owner can edit information provided in this step. Tax exemption cases # Some businesses in the US are eligible for tax exemption, meaning they do not need to pay sales tax on their subscriptions. To validate your tax-exempt status, please email us at billing@mail.cake.com with the following information: Tax Exemption Certificate addressed to CAKE.com Inc., 2100 Geng Rd STE 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA Email address associated with your subscription or the email address of the account owner We\u2019ll review your submission and apply the tax exemption accordingly. Step 3 Payment info # In this step, you need to enter all payment information including information about your credit card and check our Terms of Use . Enter your credit card information Click Finish payment You will be charged and will immediately get access to Clockify\u2019s paid features Clockify currently supports only payments made by credit card. Based on country/state selected in the Customer info , the subscription cost are displayed in one of the currencies: USD EUR CHF Important to note: Payment is tied to your workspace. If you have multiple workspaces, you need to pay a subscription fee for each workspace separately. Payment is done securely through Stripe . Clockify doesn\u2019t store any credit card information. Your subscription is automatically renewed each month/year. This way, you don\u2019t have to worry about forgetting to renew the subscription and disabling some features in the process (like locking timesheets).

Failed payments # If you have a valid subscription, but your payment failed (e.g. incorrect payment information, insufficient funds, expired credit card), you\u2019ll get a two-week grace period (payment overdue). During this grace period you can go to your Subscription page and update your payment information. After that, our payment processor will try to process the payment, again. If the payment wasn\u2019t processed by the end of the grace period, and the grace period ends, you\u2019ll be downgraded to a free plan . As a result, you won\u2019t lose your data, only access to paid features. If your payment has failed, and you\u2019re not sure why, feel free to contact Clockify support at support@clockify.me . FAQ # How to resolve failed payment? # If your payment fails and you\u2019re unsure of the reason, there are steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. First, verify if 3D Secure is enabled for your card. Making sure that 3D Secure is activated on your card can help prevent unauthorized transactions and provide added security during online payments. Also, you need to confirm whether your credit card has been authorized for online payments . Some credit cards may have restrictions or require prior approval for transactions conducted over the internet. Verifying the authorization status of your credit card can help identify any potential issues that may have led to the payment failure. Users with cards issued in India \u2013 how RBI regulation affects your subscription? # As of October, 2021, if you are a holder of a card issued in India, you need to authorize merchants (such as Clockify) to make recurring charges to your card. Since this regulation came into force, it led to an increased number of failed payments for our users with cards issued in India. Rest assured that Clockify has done everything to comply with these regulations. This means that you need to authorize Clockify to be able to collect recurring payments. Before your subscription renews, you will receive an email to confirm your payment. The email is sent to the address you entered in the Invoice information on your Subscription tab. Simply confirm the payment and everything should be alright from there. For payments with a recurring charge greater than 5,000 INR (~66 USD), you need to authorize each recurring payment. This means that every time your subscription renews, you need to confirm the payment in the confirmation email you received from Clockify. Only this way will the payment be successful.

You can enable them in: Preferences ( Mac desktop app and Windows desktop app ) / Settings ( Chrome/Firefox extension ). Can\u2019t see notifications? # If you can\u2019t see notifications for idle time, reminders, or Pomodoro, you\u2019ll have to allow the browser to send notifications. To enable notifications on Windows: Go to Notifications & actions Turn ON the Get notifications from apps and senders Make sure your browser (Chrome or Firefox) in the app list is also set to ON Turn on notifications from Clockify in Chrome Idle detection # Away from the computer but forgot to stop the timer? Clockify can detect if you accidentally leave a timer running when you leave your desk, and let you remove the idle time so your timesheets stay accurate. How idle detection works # If there\u2019s no mouse movement or keyboard strokes for X minutes, the timer will enter into idle mode. It will continue running, but it will treat those X minutes (and the time after that) as idle. When you become active, a notification will pop up, asking what you want to do with the idle time. You can choose to: Discard idle time \u2013 The timer will be stopped and the detected idle time will be removed from its total. Discard and continue \u2013 The current timer will be stopped, the detected idle time will be removed from its total, and a new timer will immediately start for the same activity. Keep idle time \u2013 The timer will keep running as it is. In order to keep idle time in the Chrome extension, simply close or dismiss the notification. What will be discarded : If you\u2019ve been active for 1h, inactive for 30m, and idle time is triggered after 15m, Clockify will discard 30m (time needed for the idle time to trigger and the time after that), leaving you with a 1h time entry. If you\u2019ve been away from the computer but stopped the timer via another device in the meantime, idle detection popup won\u2019t appear. Note: idle detection can\u2019t differentiate accidental mouse movements from normal activity. For example, if someone accidentally bumps into your desk while you\u2019re away, idle detection will register the accidental movement as a normal activity. How to set up idle detection on: MacOS desktop app (Note: if you\u2019ve downloaded Clockify for Mac from the App Store, idle detection is not available. You can download the version with idle detection here .) Windows desktop app Chrome/Firefox extension Pomodoro timer # If you\u2019re using a browser extension , or desktop app for Windows or Mac , you can set up notifications to let you know when it\u2019s time to take a short break with the Pomodoro timer. Once you\u2019re done with your break you can select to continue the last entry or start a new one. There is also an option to set a Long Break where you can simply choose after how many short breaks you take a longer break to help recover from intense burst sessions. For Long Break to work you would need to start/stop the timer from the notification pop up. If you stop the timer manually, it will reset the count sessions and start over. If you don\u2019t want to bother starting/stopping the timer, you can choose to do this automatically when the Pomodoro period or break ends. You can also enable Focus mode in Settings. Focus mode hides your time log and just shows you a visual representation of time left. You can also find a slightly different version of Pomodoro on our Mac desktop app . User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Automatic start and stop # If you\u2019re using the browser extension , Clockify can automatically start/stop the timer when the browser is opened/closed. If you forget to stop the timer at the end of the workday, you can enable automatic stop and when the computer is locked/goes to sleep/shut down, the timer will also stop (currently available only for Mac ). In case you have both idle detection and auto-stop enabled, if the timer is stopped automatically, idle detection will not trigger (meaning idle time will be kept). You can also automatically start/stop the timer at a certain time of the day using Zapier (e.g. automatically start the timer at 9 am and end any currently running timer at 5 pm). Reminders # If you keep forgetting to start a timer, Clockify can send you reminders to do that. Choose your working days, working hours, and after how much time you wish to be reminded. For example, if it\u2019s Monday \u2013 Friday between 9 am \u2013 5 pm and you haven\u2019t started the timer for 30 minutes, you\u2019ll get the notification. You can start a new timer from there, or continue the latest one. In addition to the time tracking reminder notifications, Clockify can also send your team daily and weekly reminders via email (e.g. if someone doesn\u2019t log their target of 40h/week). Weekly reminders will be sent on the day you set as the first day of the week in the Profile settings . E.g. If Monday is set as the first day in a weekly reminder and my first working day is Wednesday, a reminder will start counting from Wednesday (my first day). Reminder always picks up user\u2019s information. If possible, check with users to set the same day, time and timezone.

Clockify can detect if you accidentally leave a timer running when you leave your desk, and let you remove the idle time so your timesheets stay accurate.\n\nHow idle detection works #\n\nIf there\u2019s no mouse movement or keyboard strokes for X minutes, the timer will enter into idle mode. It will continue running, but it will treat those X minutes (and the time after that) as idle. When you become active, a notification will pop up, asking what you want to do with the idle time.\n\nYou can choose to:\n\n- Discard idle time \u2013 The timer will be stopped and the detected idle time will be removed from its total.\n- Discard and continue \u2013 The current timer will be stopped, the detected idle time will be removed from its total, and a new timer will immediately start for the same activity.\n- Keep idle time \u2013 The timer will keep running as it is. In order to keep idle time in the Chrome extension, simply close or dismiss the notification.\n\nWhat will be discarded :\u00a0 If you\u2019ve been active for 1h, inactive for 30m, and idle time is triggered after 15m, Clockify will discard 30m (time needed for the idle time to trigger and the time after that), leaving you with a 1h time entry.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been away from the computer but stopped the timer via another device in the meantime, idle detection popup won\u2019t appear.\n\nNote: idle detection can\u2019t differentiate accidental mouse movements from normal activity. For example, if someone accidentally bumps into your desk while you\u2019re away, idle detection will register the accidental movement as a normal activity.\n\nHow to set up idle detection on:\n\n- MacOS desktop app (Note: if you\u2019ve downloaded Clockify for Mac from the App Store, idle detection is not available. You can download the version with idle detection here .)\n- Windows desktop app\n- Chrome/Firefox extension", "tokens": 330, "node_type": "child", "section": "Idle detection", "anchor": "idle-detection", "breadcrumb": ["Clockify Help Center", "Track Time & Expenses", "Pomodoro, idle detection, reminders"], "updated_at": "2025-09-03T11:35:41+00:00", "title_path": ["Clockify Help Center", "Track Time & Expenses", "Pomodoro, idle detection, reminders", "Idle detection"]}

Project status shows all-time totals # The Project status page always shows data from the start of the project to the current date. It does not respond to any date range filters. What this means: If you run a report for last month, but the project started earlier, you\u2019ll see a lower total in the report. The project status will show the full total from day one of the project. How to match them more closely: Extend the report date range to cover the full project duration if you want to compare values. Time rounding doesn\u2019t apply to project status # Time rounding rules set in Workspace settings only affect reports and exports, not the project status page. What this means: If you\u2019ve rounded time entries (e.g., to the nearest 6 minutes), reports will reflect that rounded value The project status page will use actual tracked time (unrounded), resulting in small differences How to check: Open the Detailed report and turn off the rounding You\u2019ll likely see values that more closely match the project status Invoiced time is not deducted from the project status # Invoicing a time entry does not remove or subtract it from the project\u2019s tracked time or progress. What this means: If you\u2019ve already invoiced 20 hours, you might expect those to be removed from the project They\u2019ll still be counted in full as project status tracks total effort, not outstanding or un-invoiced time Project status is always displayed in decimal format # Regardless of how your workspace is configured (e.g., full, compact, or decimal format), the Project status page will always show time in decimal format. What this means: If your report says 1h 30m, the Project status page will display that as 1.5h This is just a difference in formatting, not an error or miscalculation Use the Detailed report in the decimal format if you want a side-by-side comparison that matches the project status format. Still having issues? The Clockify Support Team will be happy to look into it and assist you further.

This happens because Clockify calculated them in slightly different ways to keep things precise. Reports calculate time with more decimals than invoices # Clockify tracks time with multiple decimal places, like 1.375 hours, for example. Reports show time in full format (unless changed in the Workspace Settings), like 1:15:45 or 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 45 seconds. Invoices, on the other hand, convert and round time to two decimal places, like 1.26 hours. This difference in how time is handled leads to small variations in total. Invoices round each entry before calculating totals # When generating an invoice, Clockify rounds each time entry to 2 decimals before multiplying by the rate. Reports calculate total time first, then multiply. Example: You tracked three entries: Entry 1: 1:15:45 Entry 2: 2:45:30 Entry 3: 0:59:50 Report totals: Total time = 5:01:05 (5 hours, 1 minute, 5 seconds) At $100/h -> $501.08 Invoice totals: Entry 1: 1:15:45 -> 1.26h Entry 2: 2:45:30 -> 2.76h Entry 3: 0:59:50 -> 1.00h Total = 1.26 + 2.76 + 1.00 = 5.02h At $100/h -> $502.00 The invoice ends up showing $502.00, while the report shows $501.08, a $0.92 difference due to rounding conversion. How to match invoices and reports # To make both features calculate time in the same way, turn on time rounding for all time entries. Best option: Set rounding to the nearest 6 minutes (which equals 0.1h). Clockify uses 0.1 hours = 6 minutes as the rounding base, Since both reports and invoices will round each time entry the same way, to the nearest 6-minute block, you get consistent results across the board. Example: Let\u2019s say you have this time entry: Actual tracked time: 1:07:00 = 1.1166\u2026 hours Without rounding: Report uses 1.1166h -> $111.66 Invoice rounds: 1.12h -> $112.00 $0.34 difference With rounding to the nearest six minutes: 1:07:00 rounds to 1.1h (because 6 minutes = 0.1h) Both report and invoice use 1.1h -> $110.00 By rounding to a number divisible by 6, all entries land on the same time unit (e.g., 1.0h, 1.1h, 1.2h\u2026), which removes all seconds that cause mismatches.

By knowing the real length of the project, you\u2019ll know if you\u2019re charging enough or if you\u2019re losing money. For example, you might tell a client you need 50 hours for a project, 20 for design and 30 for coding. So you arrange a fixed price, thinking you\u2019ll finish it in under 50 hours. But how much time will you really need? The bigger the project, the greater the error will be. But if you track time, you\u2019ll know exactly how much time each activity takes and whether you made money on a project. Let\u2019s say you finish the project in 70 hours, which is 20 hours more than estimated. You can negotiate with the client for a higher price or less work. But even if you charge as if you had worked 50 hours, at least you\u2019ll estimate better in the future and won\u2019t lose money. Let\u2019s say you start a new fixed-fee project. Here\u2019s an example of what your Clockify workflow could look like. Initial setup # To have time entries categorized , first define client\u2019s name on the Clients page. You can also define tags with the type of activities (e.g. project management). This way, you can filter time entries by tags and track how much time each activity takes. Create a new project and select the client Add tasks to the project (e.g. Design, Development) Use task-based estimate (e.g. Design task: 20h, Development task: 30h) or enter a manual estimate (e.g. 50h for the whole project) Set up billable rates , as well as labor cost rates Subsequent configuration # After the project starts: When you track time , make sure each time entry has a project and a task. When you hit some milestone (e.g. finished design), check project status for estimated vs tracked time. If you\u2019re way over your original estimate, you might want to talk to the client about adjusting the budget, requirements, and timeline. Once the project ends, go to Summary report and filter entries by the project. Then, export the report in CSV and import it to Excel where you can: better analyze data, see what activities took longer than planned, analyze why, and set better estimates (and prices) in the future. In reports, view either amounts for billing, cost, or profit (the difference between the two) Related articles # Overview of hourly rates Cost rate Create projects & clients Use tasks Time categorization & tags Was this article helpful?

In this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through the essential steps for configuring your Workspace, managing users, and customizing settings to meet the needs of your team. What is a Workspace? # A workspace is a collection of people and projects in Clockify. When you first register at Clockify, you\u2019ll automatically get a Clockify workspace and your CAKE.com Account with an organization in it. You can also join a Clockify workspace in an existing CAKE.com organization . A workspace contains all the time entries, projects, people, and settings. Visibility # Only people who are part of the Workspace can view and interact with its data. You can be a member of multiple Workspaces at once and switch between them easily. Multiple Workspaces # With a single Clockify account, you can create or join multiple workspaces. These workspaces are separate entities, each with their own unique set of users, projects, and time entries. Multiple workspaces are useful when you want to have a separate account for each sub-company or a department. This is ideal if you need to segregate time tracking and projects across various teams. For example, if you have two companies or departments, you can create two workspaces, and invite different people to each one. Then, you can switch between them as needed. Or, you can be a team member in one workspace and track time for the company you work for, plus have a personal workspace where you\u2019ll keep track of personal stuff and be admin. Workspace settings # As a Workspace Owner or Admin , you have access to configure the settings for your Workspace.

This is disabled by default, so viewers can go through different date ranges when viewing the report. If you choose a relative date range (e.g. This week, Last month, etc.) instead of a custom date range, you\u2019ll also get the option Always open as\u2026 This means that the report will be always displayed for the last or current day, week, or month when opened (which you can change depending on the settings of lock dates option).

Overview of shared reports # You can access all the reports you\u2019ve created, or that someone shared with you on the Shared tab. Each report you\u2019ve created, you can search via Search by name box at the top of the page, or edit and delete by clicking on the three dots and choosing the proper option (edit sharing details, delete) or see which filters are applied in a report. Shared reports always reflect the creator\u2019s current set of permissions (what data they can see) and settings (their timezone and week start at the moment of creation). For example, if you are an admin and you create a link to the report where you can see billable amounts and all time entries, but you later become a regular user, the link to the report won\u2019t work because you as the creator of the link don\u2019t have access to that information any more. Also, keep in mind that admins can see all public shared reports, even if they\u2019re not shared with them directly. Shared reports page shows the links you\u2019ve personally created and those that other users shared with you. Additionally to that, you can see the list of users with whom you can share reports. Once a shared report is deleted, the link will become inactive and browser will display a blank page.

You\u2019ll receive an email with instructions to manually unlock your account before the 24-hour lock expires.\n\nWhat is a verification code and how long is it valid? #\n\nA verification code is a 6-character code (numbers and letters) sent to your email when you sign up or log in. The code is valid for 30 seconds and needs to be entered promptly to complete the verification process.\n\nWhat if I forget my email or can\u2019t find my verification email? #\n\nIf you can\u2019t find the verification email, make sure to check your spam or junk folder. If you still can\u2019t find it, request a new verification email by clicking the Resend verification link.\n\nCan I log in using single sign-on (SSO)? #\n\nYes, if your workspace is connected to an identity provider, you can log in using SSO (Single Sign-On). This allows you to skip entering your login credentials each time you access Clockify. Admins can set up SSO from the Workspace settings .\n\nWhat happens if I try to log in with an email address that is not associated with my account? #\n\nIf you attempt to log in with an email address that doesn\u2019t have a Clockify account, you\u2019ll be redirected to the signup page to create a new account with that email.\n\nWhat is the SSO login process? #\n\nAdmins can set up Single Sign-On (SSO) by linking Clockify to an identity provider like Google Workspace , Okta , or Microsoft Azure AD . Once SSO is enabled, users can log in directly using their organization\u2019s SSO credentials, bypassing the need for separate login details.\n\nWhat should I do if my account is locked? #\n\nIf your account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts:\n\n- You\u2019ll receive an email notifying you of the lockout\n- You can manually unlock your account by following the instructions in the email. The lock will automatically expire in 24 hours.\n\nCan I use multiple accounts with Clockify? #\n\nYes, Clockify allows you to create and manage multiple workspaces. If you have different accounts or workspaces, you\u2019ll need to log in separately to each one. You can switch between them from the workspace selector if you\u2019re logged into multiple accounts.\n\nWas this article helpful? Submit Cancel Thank you!

This is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Enterprise plan . In order to use SSO, you first need to move your workspace to subdomain. Once you do that, you can configure SSO settings and disable other login methods. Setting up custom subdomain # Moving to subdomain # Before you can configure and start using SSO for authorization, you need to move your Clockify app domain to a custom subdomain . When you upgrade your Clockify subscription to Enterprise plan , you will get Authentication tab in the Workspace settings . There, you can enter the subdomain you\u2019d like to use and move your workspace there. To set up subdomain: Navigate to the Authentication tab in the Workspace settings Enter your custom subdomain in the provided field Click Create subdomain and Create to confirm the action After you created your subdomain and moved your workspace there, Google login will no longer work for you and your users. If you\u2019d, however, like to use Google login, you need to set it up manually by configuring OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) for SSO . For more information, check out the OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) with Google section below. Accessing Clockify from subdomain # After you create your subdomain, you\u2019ll automatically be logged out of any apps you were logged in with your Clockify account. You\u2019ll have access to them only through the subdomain you created (e.g. https://yourcompanysubdomain.clockify.me/login). Workspaces on subdomain # Subdomain is tied to only one workspace. Users on subdomain can\u2019t have multiple workspaces: there is no workspace switcher, no workspaces in the sidebar, and no access to subdomain workspace from the main domain. To access multiple workspaces, log in to the main Clockify domain. Changing subdomain # You can change subdomain URL at any time. Once you change your URL, your Users will be logged out and will have to use the workspace through the new URL. If you cancel the subscription to the Enterprise plan: you\u2019ll move back to the main domain when the subscription expires your subdomain will become available for others to use your users will have to log in with their email API keys on subdomain # For security reasons, each user on subdomain gets a separate API key that works only for that workspace \u2013 meaning, no one can access your data on your subdomain unless they have the right authorization. If, for example, there is a user with two separate Enterprise workspaces, workspace owners can\u2019t see, or access data from each others accounts. Inviting new users # Once you\u2019re in the subdomain workspace, you can invite users one by one using email (like before), or let anyone join without you having to manually invite them. To let anyone join, check the Users can join without an invite checkbox. If you use SSO and someone without an account tries to log in, the account will be automatically created for them and they\u2019ll log in. If you allow Log in with email , people will be able to create an account and automatically join your workspace. Configuring SSO # If you\u2019d like to use SSO via your mobile devices (android or iOS) all the SSO configurations supported by Clockify should contain [yourcompany subdomain].clockify.me links. For example, in the Redirect URL section add https://yourcompanysubdomain.clockify.me/login/android/oauth2 or https://yourcompanysubdomain.clockify.me/login/ios/oauth2 link. Clockify supports all major SSO identity providers: SAML 2.0 ( Google , OneLogin , Okta , Azure , Rippling , JumpCloud ) OAuth 2.0 (OIDC) ( Google , Azure , Okta ) Only workspace owner can see Authorization tab, manage subdomain, configure SSO, and turn SSO on/off. If you wish to force everyone to log in with SSO, simply turn off the Log in with email option. Once this change has been saved, your workspace members accounts will be required to use SSO to log in. Data in the SSO configuration can always be edited or deleted. If deleted, your users will have to switch back to logging in by using email. Owner can always log in using the original credentials at https://mysubdomain.clockify.me/login-owner To add Default Relay State , use the parameters below.

Use Time tracker or Calendar to split entries based on either their duration, or specific times of the day and add more flexibility and precision when managing your time. Split entry option is available to users on paid plans and on Free trial . All users can perform this action, but admins can split time for all other team members in Calendar. However, if Who can edit time and expenses for others is set to Admins and Team managers , then Team managers are also able to split time for their team members in Calendar. You can split both time and break entries. The step-by-step procedure is the same. Time tracker # Time tracker contains a list of time/break entries that have been tracked, or those currently running in a workspace. Time can be split for the running and existing entries. The steps are the same with the only difference being the type of entry you\u2019re choosing in the Time tracker (the one that is running, or the one from the list). To split entry: Go to Time tracker page Navigate to the entry you\u2019d like to split Click on the three dots Choose Split option In the Split at box write the time at which you\u2019d like the split to occur or Toggle the bar on the timeline to the number you\u2019d like to split Click Save to complete the action If you split a running entry, as a result, you\u2019ll get two entries with the first one having start and end time and the second one running with the start time being the end time of the first one. For example: Entry has been running since 9:00 and now it\u2019s 12:30. You split it at 10:00 and now you have two entries, with the first one being 9:00 \u2013 10:00 and the second one 10:00 and running. Entries can be split a minute after the start time and a minute before the ending time, meaning that entries shorter than two minutes cannot be split. If there are multiple identical hours and minutes for which the entry spans, you can split time via the input field only for the first one. If an entry has screenshots, they are split between two entries based on the time of creation. For example: The entry lasts 10:00 \u2013 10:30. It is split to: 10:00 \u2013 10:15 and 10:15 \u2013 10: 30. The screenshots created in the 10:00 \u2013 10:15 time span belong to that time entry. Same goes for the other split entry. The same logic applies to GPS location tracking. They are also split between two entries based on the time of creation. Modify duration # Duration of split entries can be modified: Navigate to the blue circle Move the arrow to the left or right Entries are dynamic and change in real time to match new end time and duration.\u00a0As one half of the timeline changes, the other one changes dynamically according to that. Calendar # You can also split running and already created entries in the Calendar. Steps are the same. Go to the Calendar page Click on the running/existing entry Edit windows appears Click on the three dots menu at the bottom left corner Choose Split option In the Split at box write the time at which you\u2019d like the split to occur or Toggle the bar on the timeline to the number you\u2019d like to split Click Save to complete the action If Force timer is on, the split time option is not available at all. Pending approvals # Admins and Team managers (for their teams) can perform this action only if Who can edit time and expenses for others is set to Admins and team managers .

The steps are the same with the only difference being the type of entry you\u2019re choosing in the Time tracker (the one that is running, or the one from the list).\n\nTo split entry:\n\n1.

Click Save to complete the action\n\nIf you split a running entry, as a result, you\u2019ll get two entries with the first one having start and end time and the second one running with the start time being the end time of the first one. For example: Entry has been running since 9:00 and now it\u2019s 12:30. You split it at 10:00 and now you have two entries, with the first one being 9:00 \u2013 10:00 and the second one 10:00 and running.\n\nEntries can be split a minute after the start time and a minute before the ending time, meaning that entries shorter than two minutes cannot be split.\n\nIf there are multiple identical hours and minutes for which the entry spans, you can split time via the input field only for the first one.\n\nIf an entry has screenshots, they are split between two entries based on the time of creation. For example: The entry lasts 10:00 \u2013 10:30. It is split to: 10:00 \u2013 10:15 and 10:15 \u2013 10: 30. The screenshots created in the 10:00 \u2013 10:15 time span belong to that time entry.

Subscribe now and redefine your time tracking experience. Opt for the subscription plan you like the most, priced per user seat, and transform your workspace into a more advanced environment. Before you upgrade, make sure you\u2019re logged into your workspace. Keep in mind that the upgrade cost depends on the number of active team members, regardless of their roles or the features they use. Key concepts # Get familiar with key concepts and processes you might come across when working with upgrades and subscriptions on Clockify. Billing & seats # Please be aware that you will be charged each billing cycle for the total number of user seats you have. So, if you have more user seats than the active users in the workspace, you will be charged for all user seats whether they are used or not. You only need to buy a seat for an active user in your workspace. If a user is deactivated, manually remove their seat from the Subscription page. Activated users count as used seats and total number of seats represent the number of seats available in that workspace. For example: You paid an annual subscription for two user seats. You had two active users for a couple of months and then deactivated one. Now, you have one vacant user seat and you can invite new user that will take up that seat. This means that each time you deactivate a user, you free up a seat they used to occupy. User seats # Represent the number of active team members you can have in your workspace. When you subscribe to a paid plan for the first time, you must buy a seat for each active user, but you can also buy more seats if you plan on inviting more users in the future. Bundle seats # Represent a number of active members on Clockify, Pumble and Plaky workspaces purchased with Bundle subscription plan within CAKE.com Productivity Suite. For detailed instructions on how manage Bundle seats, check out Bundle seats article. Team member # Team member is every active user that joins or is invited in the workspace regardless of their user role and features they use. Every time a new user joins or is invited to your workspace, they take up one user seat. If there are no available user seats left, you won\u2019t be able to invite users and they won\u2019t be able to join your workspace. Full & limited users # While using kiosk , you\u2019ll come across two types of users: Full and Limited . Full users refer to team members when the Kiosk feature is enabled, while Limited users are those that have restricted access and can only clock in/out as required. If you\u2019d like to add Limited users to your workspace, you\u2019ll be charged for that separately. Manage user seats # If you\u2019ve used all available user seats in your workspace, you can add more users by purchasing additional seats on the Subscription page in the app. Only workspace owners/admins can manage subscriptions and add/remove user seats. Clockify Subscription page # The Subscription page allows you to manage user seats, have an overview of all your invoices and subscription plans with the option to upgrade/downgrade to the subscription plan that suits your needs. To access Subscription page: Open the three-dots menu next to the workspace name Choose Subscription from the dropdown You\u2019ll be redirected to the Subscription page When you land on the Subscription page, you\u2019ll see three tabs: Billing Invoices Plans Billing tab tracks your current subscription plan, price, used and available user seats and all the features at your disposal available with your subscription plan. It also includes all your customer , invoice and payment information . The progress bar in your current plan tracks the number of used vs purchased user seats. If there are available user seats in the workspace, the bar is blue, if there are no seats left, the bar is red. Click on View price breakdown to see a detailed overview of all charges related to your subscription, including the subscription fee, number of seats, billing plan type, taxes, and any additional fees. This way you can review the total cost at any time. Clockify doesn\u2019t provide refunds for removed user seats. Invoices tab keeps track of all your past invoices and billing statements. Plans tab provides the list of subscription plans and upgrade/downgrade options. For more information, check out Payment process . To remove a Bundle seat , get in touch with our support team . Unpaid invoice # If you have an unpaid invoice, and would like to add more user seats, you will be informed that you first need to pay the invoice in order to proceed. Click on the Check unpaid invoices button and you\u2019ll open the Invoices tab in a new window, where you can review and pay the invoice. Subscription billing intervals # You can submit your payments periodically: Annually Monthly If you opt for the annual billing period, you get 20% off. Switch billing intervals # In the Subscription page, you can switch between two billing periods (monthly/annual) at any time. Annual to monthly : You\u2019ll switch to monthly subscription plan after your current annual subscription ends Monthly to annual : You\u2019ll be immediately charged a prorated price (annual price minus the remaining calculation from your current plan) If you switch from your phone or tablet and you don\u2019t see the link in the Subscription page, go to the Upgrade page and you\u2019ll see the annual billing link next to monthly.

Download for Windows \u2192 Download for Mac \u2192 Windows and Mac desktop apps have integrated screenshots. Screenshots is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan. Data gathering and privacy # Screenshots can\u2019t be recorded without user\u2019s knowledge. In order to record screenshots: Admin has to enable \u201cActivate screenshot capturing\u201d in workspace settings All workspace members will receive a notification when screenshot capturing is enabled via both the web and the desktop app Screenshots are taken only while the timer is running (regardless of where you started the timer) AND if you have the screenshot recording app installed Screenshots are low-resolution and blurred for privacy and security reasons, by default. However, admins and owners can set a higher resolution on a workspace level. Each regular user can see all their screenshots. Admin sees all screenshots in the workspace Each screenshot is tied to a time entry. If the time entry is deleted, its screenshots are also deleted. If a user deletes a screenshot, the time between the previous and current screenshot will be subtracted from the total time You can go back and see the screenshots up to a year from the moment they were created. All screenshots older than one year are automatically deleted forever. Clockify can also: Record which apps you use and websites you visit using auto tracker , but that data is completely private (data is not available to workspace admins). Detect when you\u2019re inactive using idle detection (no mouse movement or keystrokes), but that data is shown only once when you become active again, so you can decide if you wish to keep, or exclude idle time (information is not available to workspace admins). Record screenshots # To capture screenshots, you need to install the desktop app for Mac or Windows. Once installed, you\u2019ll need to log in and start the timer. Screenshots are captured randomly in 5-minute intervals while the timer is running and the desktop app is active. For instance, if we take a look at 20 minutes of tracked time, within those 20 minutes, there are four 5-minute intervals. Let\u2019s say that the timer is started at 12:15. The first five-minute interval is 12:15-12:20. The first screenshot, is taken after five minutes, at the end of this first interval, at 12:20. All other screenshots are taken 3-8 minutes after the interval started. Screenshots won\u2019t be taken if the duration of a time entry is less than 5 minutes, or if the timer is running on the web or mobile, but not on the desktop app (or you\u2019re not logged in). When Mac prompts you, you have to allow Clockify to take screenshots. If you click Deny, you\u2019ll have to go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Screen Recording and check Clockify app. View screenshots # When screenshots are enabled, all users in the workspace will see the Activity > Screenshots page in the sidebar. Regular users can see all their personal screenshots, and admins can see everyone\u2019s. All active users in the workspace are listed, and next to each person you can see a total number of recorded screenshots in that day. If a person has screenshots, you can click on their name, or the expand icon in the right corner to see the screenshots, time when each was recorded, as well as the name of a project, task and client, if available. You can click on a screenshot to open a gallery view, and then go back and forth between the screenshots. To see screenshots for other days, click on < or > in the upper right corner next to the date (you can go back up to one year from the time when the screenshot was taken). Delete screenshots # Admins can delete anyone\u2019s screenshots. Regular users can delete only their own screenshots, unless the time entry is locked or approved. Only Admin can delete locked or approved time entries. To delete a screenshot: Hover over a screenshot you want to delete Click on a trash icon In the confirmation screen, click Delete to complete the action Important considerations # After you delete a screenshot of: Time entry that\u2019s approved , time entry remains Time entry that\u2019s not approved , time entry is deleted Also note that: Admins can delete screenshots for everyone without the subtraction of the time entry\u2019s total time. After a regular user deletes a screenshot, the time between that and the screenshot before it will be subtracted from the time entry\u2019s total time. If an entry has only one screenshot, a whole time entry will be deleted. If a time entry with a screenshot is deleted by users or admin, all the screenshots related to that entry are automatically deleted. If user deletes their account, all their screenshots are also deleted. Screenshots older than a year are automatically deleted forever. To delete a screenshot that was captured from a currently running timer, you first need to stop the timer, and then you can delete a desired screenshot. There is no undo action when a screenshot is deleted. Each deletion is permanent and non-retrievable. Offline mode # In the offline mode, screenshots are collected by the app and stored locally.

If a team member doesn\u2019t meet their target or logs more time than needed, they will automatically receive an email reminder. Managers and admins can also get notified on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis about team members who have missed their targets or tracked too much time. Targets and reminders is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan. There are also You forgot to start the timer reminders , which you can enable inside time tracking apps (desktop app and browser extension, free feature). Types of reminders # User reminders notify individual users if they haven\u2019t tracked enough hours for a specified period (daily/weekly/monthly) Manager/Admin/Owner reminders inform team managers, admins and owners when any workspace member misses their target hours Set up timesheet reminders # As an owner or admin, you can configure reminders for your users on the Team page > Reminders tab . Here\u2019s how to customize them: Choose Their work capacity to set reminders based on each user\u2019s individual work capacity (calculated automatically) Select Custom time to set a fixed target of hours You can define the target hours for each user for daily, weekly, or monthly tracking. Once configured, Clockify will automatically send reminder emails when a team member doesn\u2019t meet their target or logs more than the target number of hours. Customize reminder settings For Daily , Weekly , and Monthly reminders: Period selection : When setting reminders, you can select the time period (Daily, Weekly, Monthly) Target type : Choose whether reminders are based on the user\u2019s work capacity or a custom-defined time target. If custom time is selected, you will be prompted to enter a specific number of hours. Defaults : Daily: 8 hours Weekly: 40 hours Monthly: 160 hours Adjustable limits : The field for custom hours has a minimum of 0 hours and a maximum of: Daily: 24 hours Weekly: 168 hours Monthly: 744 hours User-specific reminders # Daily reminders : If you\u2019ve set Day , team members will receive the reminder email the following day (you can choose workdays for when people have to fulfill their targets) Weekly reminders : If you\u2019ve configured a weekly reminder, team members will receive the notification on the first day of the next week ( week start ). The default start day of the week can be set by the Owner or Admin in the Workspace settings under the Week start section. However, individual users can have their own Week start adjusted if the Owner or Admin updates their settings on the Team page > Edit profile . For example, if Monday is set as the default start day but your first working day is Wednesday, reminders will be scheduled starting from Wednesday, aligning with your personal schedule. The reminder system will always use the user\u2019s specific information. To ensure consistency, it\u2019s a good idea for users to coordinate their start days, times, and time zones if possible. Monthly reminder : If you\u2019ve set a Month , team members will receive the reminder email on the first day of the next month You can set up multiple reminder rules for each user or group (e.g. 7 hours per day minimum, but 40 hours per week and 150 hours per month). User groups for bulk reminders To save time, you can allocate users to groups . This allows you to assign reminders to multiple people at once instead of selecting each user individually. Time off and holidays There are no reminders during time off. Users on holidays or who have approved time off will not receive reminders for the days they\u2019re absent. Users who haven\u2019t verified their email address won\u2019t receive reminders. Emails for admins and managers # If you wish to receive an email when someone forgets to log their time or they log too much time, click on a reminder\u2019s Them option, and select who also needs to receive the email (admin, team manager). The reminders for them will include: Missed targets : When a team member\u2019s tracked time is below the target, it will appear in red text in the email Summary email : All daily, weekly, and monthly reminders for team members can be included in one email Customized notes : The subject and email body will include a note with details about the specific time off taken by the user Edit reminders # To edit a reminder simply click on the highlighted section (users, hours, etc.). Key considerations # Time off calculations : When a user requests time off (daily, half-day, or hourly), the system recalculates their available capacity. If the user has taken time off, their recalculated work capacity will be used for reminders. Full day off : The daily work capacity is set to 0 hours Half day off : The daily work capacity is halved Hourly off : The work capacity is reduced based on the approved hours Non-working days : If a user is on a holiday or non-working day, no reminders will be sent for that day.

For further categorization, you can also use tags, which work regardless of the hierarchy. If you wish to categorize time differently, you can rename Project, Client, and Task labels into something else. How to organize time entries # If you do client work , name projects with the title of the assignment given by your client (e.g. \u201cE-commerce Analytics\u201d, \u201cWebsite Redesign\u201d, \u201cSuperApp\u201d). You can also have a special project where you\u2019ll put all non-billable time entries (e.g. emails, time-off, meetings). If you do client work but want to keep it simple , you can just use client\u2019s name as the project name and then use tasks to indicate what type of service you\u2019ve provided (you can also change the project label to say client instead). If you have common projects for different clients , you can use projects for the type of service (e.g. marketing, development) and use tags to indicate for which client a particular time entry was. If you don\u2019t work with clients , you can use projects as general areas of work (e.g. sales, operations, support). If you use Clockify for tracking personal productivity , you can name projects by activity (e.g. emails, working, learning, cooking). Clients, projects, and tasks # Projects are the main way in which you can organize your time in Clockify. At a higher level, you can group projects around clients (or departments or whatever else). Learn more about managing projects . Clients are used to organize projects. A client can have many projects, but a project can belong to only one client. It\u2019s not possible to add just a client to a time entry as clients are used as a grouping mechanism for projects. However, you can create a project named after a client. Alternatively, you can create a tag for each client and add it to a time entry, so you can later group entries by tag. If you need more control, you can further classify time entries using tasks (i.e. sub-projects or jobs) and use them to designate the type of work (e.g. design, writing, programming), or whatever else you want (e.g. bugs, sprint A, phase X). While tasks are commonly used to designate the type of activity (e.g. Design, Coding), the description field is most commonly used for the actual thing you\u2019ve worked on (e.g. \u201cFix bug #638\u201d). Change labels # By default, time in Clockify can be categorized by Client/Project/Task. To change these labels into something else: Go to Settings Find Organize time by Choose what you wish to rename Manage clients # By default, owners and admins can create clients. However, this set of permissions can be modified if Who can create projects and clients is set to Admins and managers or Anyone in the Workspace settings . Who can create clients if selected: Admins (default): admins Admins and project managers : admins and project manager Anyone : admins, projects managers, team managers, regular users Regular users will be able to create clients when they create a new project. However, they still won\u2019t be able to see the Clients page. How owners, admins and project managers can create clients # If you\u2019re the owner or an admin of the workspace, to create a client simply: Go to Clients page from the sidebar Enter the client\u2019s name in the Add new client field Click Add How regular users can create clients # If you want regular users to be able to add clients: Admin or owner needs to set Who can create projects and clients to Anyone A regular user can then go to the Projects page to create a project Click Select client Enter client name Click Create client or press Ctrl /^ (Control) + Enter If you want to create a client only, simply create the client with the mentioned steps above and cancel the project creation.

Tags work regardless of the project, so you can create one tag, use it on multiple projects and filter reports based on them. You can even use multiple tags to filter reports with more precision. Tags can also be used to add additional information to time entries. For example, you can: Mark time entries with non-standard billing rates or currencies so you know how to invoice them Mark time entries you\u2019ve invoiced with invoiced tag so you don\u2019t bill a client twice (you can use bulk edit to update multiple entries at once) Mark what type of work or service you provide (e.g. project management, feedback, debugging, coding), so you can see how much time takes to perform a specific type of work across all projects Mark what part of business you\u2019re working on (e.g. internal, support, client work, mobile) Mark the amount of time you worked overtime Tags are useful because you can use them as keywords by which you can filter reports to find exactly what you need. Before you can use tags, you have to create them by typing a new tag name in the tag picker and pressing Ctrl / ^ (Control) + Enter . Once you\u2019ve created a tag, all users in your workspace can select it when tracking time. Everyone can create tags (though you can limit creation to Admins only in workspace settings). Only admins can edit, and delete tags. You can create as many tags as you want.

Delete tags in bulk # Check the Name box on the Tags page Click Delete Type DELETE in the popup windows Click Delete to confirm the action All deleted tags will be removed from time entries they are assigned to. Filter reports by tags # You can filter time entries in reports in three ways: Contains \u2013 all entries that contain that tag will be shown (e.g. if an entry has tag A and B, and you filter Contains: A , that entry will show up) Doesn\u2019t contain \u2013 only entries that don\u2019t have that tag will be shown (e.g. if an entry has tag A and B, and you filter Doesn\u2019t contain: A , that entry won\u2019t show up) Contains only \u2013 only entries that have that and only that tag will be shown (e.g. if an entry has tag A and B, and you filter Contains: only A , only that entry will show up) How editing tags works # If you change the name of the tag in Tags section, time entries that have this tag applied will remain tagged with the renamed tag If you use bulk edit to change tags on time entries, you will have the option to add a new tag to existing or overwrite existing If you delete a tag all time entries that had this tag applied will end up untagged. Advanced organization # Clockify lets you categorize time even further with custom fields . Custom field is a paid feature which you can enable by upgrading to PRO plan. Custom fields let your users add additional information to time entries (e.g. expenses, mileage, etc.), plus you can auto-categorize time entries based on a project. For example, if some projects are done in one location and the others in another, you can create a custom field called location and tell which project belongs to which location. Then, when you download a report, you\u2019ll be able to create a custom report , and group and sort time by location. Related articles # Create projects & clients Use tasks Was this article helpful?

For example, you can round time to the nearest whole minute in reports so you don\u2019t get distracted by seconds when looking at a report. Or, you can round time to the nearest 6 minutes and export them to get all time entries displayed as a nice round number with just one decimal. Time rounding is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard , Pro , or Enterprise paid plan. Turn on rounding # To round time entries, go to any report, and toggle the Rounding switch. To choose a different rounding option, click on the dropdown next to Rounding and choose Settings. Rounding is applied to each time entry. Rounding only affects the reports, meaning that the rounded values will only be displayed in the reports and exports. What rounding affects when it\u2019s ON # Time rounding only affects the reports and can be turned on and off as you wish. Calculating duration : Clockify will first round the duration of each time entry, and then add them up. Export : durations and values will be rounded in the export too. Calculated earnings : when calculating the value of your billable hours, Clockify takes rounded time entries. Detailed report : you can\u2019t edit time entries in the Detailed report when the rounding is on. Time rounding doesn\u2019t change any data, only how it\u2019s displayed, which can always be turned on/off. If you set the rounding to the nearest minute, your 00:10:56 time entry will be displayed as 00:11:00 once you turn the rounding on. And it will go back to 00:10:56 when you turn the rounding off. Rounding options # You can set the rounding interval and how you want to round time entries in your workspace settings: Round down (for example: if the interval is set to 30min, a 1-29min entry will show up in reports as 0min) Round up (for example: if the interval is set to 30min, a 1-29min entry will show up in reports as 30min) Round to nearest (for example: if the interval is set to 30min, a 1-14min entry will show up in reports as 0min, and a 16-29min entry as 30min) If your duration format is set to hh: mm in your Workspace settings, time entry will be rounded up to a minute. For example, if you tracked 0 hours, 1 minute, and 15 seconds (00:01:15), the entry will be shown as 0 hours and 2 minutes (00:02). This is not a part of the time rounding feature and you can change the duration format in the Workspace settings on any plan, including the free plan.

For an overall guidance on how to use a Timesheet in Clockify, watch the video and follow the instructions below. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. To enable Timesheet: Go to the Workspace settings In General tab, go to the Timesheet > Activate timesheet section Toggle the switch on to activate timesheet Timesheet view is a much quicker method for adding time and is perfect for employees who are used to filling their timesheets manually at the end of the day and need to enter a lot of time at once. Simply select the projects/tasks you were working on during the week, and fill time for each day. Add time # Choose a project/task you were working on Write how much you\u2019ve worked on that task that day Add a row for each additional project/task you worked on Switch to a different week using the date navigation in the top-right corner To add more details (description, tag, start/end time, set billable status), hover over a cell with time and click on the three dots If you type 1, it will become 1min. But if you switch to decimal format , 1 will become 1h. If the start and end time include an overnight period, there will be a superscript number next to the end time, showing how many additional days the time entry covers. Time Tracker and Timesheet share your time data. So, if you add time via Time Tracker, you\u2019ll see that time in the Timesheet, and vice versa. All users can edit or delete their time, as long as it hasn\u2019t been locked . You can also delete time by clicking on the X. If you a delete time entry in the timesheet, all the time associated with that task for that week will be deleted, so be careful. Time added through the Timesheet will inherit the project\u2019s billability status . If you wish to change the billability status, use the Time Tracker, or hover over a cell with the time, click on the three dots and make the change. Once the Timesheet view is enabled, Project becomes a required field automatically and can\u2019t be turned off (meaning all time entries must have a project before they can be added). The first entry you create for that day gets its start time from your Day start ( Time settings ) in the Profile settings. Each subsequent entry for that day will be auto-incremented, based on the order you enter time. Create new timesheets quickly # When a new week starts, you\u2019ll get an empty timesheet for that week. Quickly populate your empty timesheet with tasks using one of the options: Copy last week If you work on the same tasks day-to-day, you can copy over the projects and tasks from the most recent timesheet, without any tracked time. Choose if you\u2019d like to Copy activities only , or Copy activities and time . Templates Create a timesheet template containing projects and tasks from any week. When your timesheet is empty, select the template from the dropdown menu at the bottom, and your timesheet will automatically populate with the projects and tasks from the chosen template. You have the flexibility to apply one or multiple templates to your timesheet. Please note that timesheet templates are accessible only to the user who created them. The Copy Last Week and Templates options are available when your timesheet is empty and the approval period is set to Weekly . Once applied, the status of the entry changes to Applied . If entries in the template overlap with existing entries in the timesheet, users can specify how to handle these conflicts in the Apply Template modal. You can choose to: Replace the existing time entries with those from the template Skip and the template will ignore cells where time entries already exist. Add will incorporate time entries from the template with the existing ones After successfully applying a template, a shading animation will highlight the outline of all updated cells. This can help you easily identify the cells that have been added or updated on the currently active timesheet. Add time for others in Timesheet # Adding time for others is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your account to the Basic subscription plan. Owners and Admins can add, edit, or view anyone\u2019s time entries. Team managers can add, edit, or view time entries for their team members, if granted permission in Who can edit time and expenses for others Workspace settings.

Tracking holidays and time-offs plays an important role in achieving that. Apart from creating time off and holiday requests, you can track approved time off requests and holidays with the project you choose. Tracking time off and holidays is available on Standard, higher subscription plans and Trial. After the Trial version expires, all the time off/holiday entries will remain and once you upgrade again, you will be able to see everything you\u2019ve previously worked on. If you downgrade, you won\u2019t be able to edit, but time off and holiday entries will remain. Permissions # This feature can only be used by workspace Owners and Admins. Regular users can only see time off entries. They can\u2019t start , stop , or modify them in any way. If the Time off functionality is disabled in the workspace settings, Regular users can still see those that have been previously created. Time off policy and holiday # To create time off and holiday entries, you need to enable this option in the Time off page when creating time off policy or holiday . Navigate to the Time off page Click the Settings button at the top right part of the screen Choose Manage holidays Edit the existing holiday by clicking on the three dots Or Click CREATE NEW to create new holiday Check the Automatically create time entries option Choose the project The project you chose is the default project (task if there is one for that project) on the time entries that are going to be created from the time off requests and holidays. You can choose one active project with or without tasks. As a result, on the first day of the user\u2019s holiday, holiday entries for all the days of the holiday will be created. Holiday entry will also be created if a holiday is during a non-working day. If holiday and time off requests overlap, both time off and holiday entries will be created. Time off/Holiday entries can be created in one of the following ways: Time off request is approved and creates time off entry Current day is holiday and holiday is created If the Time off policy doesn\u2019t require approval, a time off request will be immediately approved and a new Time off entry created. Time off entry # When a project (task) is assigned to a time-off policy and a new time off request is approved, for every date in the request date range, a new time off entry is created. Both holiday/time off entries are marked with a time off icon. When you assign a project or task to a policy and there are requests waiting for approval, Clockify makes time-off entries for those requests once they\u2019re approved. Only owner and admin can delete time off/holiday entries. Those entries won\u2019t be deleted if the holiday/time off is deleted or the user is removed from the holiday. Time off and holiday entries can be created for both full and limited users. Full day, half-day or an hourly time-off/holiday request entry can contain the following information: description project task currency (multiple currency options if the subscription allows, if not, default currency) start time duration end time billability (pulled from project/task) custom fields (pulled from project or workspace settings) Required fields # Required fields won\u2019t be transferred to the Time off/holiday entry. Therefore, any required field that may have been set with regular entries, won\u2019t be set with the time off entries including project/task. Time tracker # Time off and holiday entries have a gray time off icon. They are locked for all users except admins and workspace owners. If the Time off/holiday entry is approved, it will have a checkmark next to it. Continue time off entry: Regular user: As regular entry Admin/owner: As time off entry Timesheet # Time off/Holiday row on the Timesheet page is marked with (Time off) or (Holiday) so that it\u2019s differentiated from the regular entry. It is locked and uneditable for regular users. Admins/owners can add time for other team members in time off/holiday entries and add/edit/delete time off entries. Calendar # On the Calendar page, the Time off/Holiday entry gets a Time off icon (clock). The entry marked as a time off entry will have a clock and will be disabled. If the time off entry is approved, the entry will have an approved icon. If the Time off entry is not approved, admins and ws owners will be able to duplicate/edit and delete them and see time off/holiday entries for other people. Reports # Detailed report : Time off entries have a time off icon next to Tags and are locked and disabled for regular users. Summary and Weekly report : Duration of Time off and Holiday entries is included in the total time on the Reports. Changes in the filtering option, by type: Break Time off Holiday Regular entry If the Time off feature is turned on, the user will get Time off and Holiday options in the Status filter.

Approval # Time off and Holiday entries are visible on the Approvals page with all the regular entries. Time off entries will be distinctly marked with an icon.

For an overall guidance on projects, watch the video and follow the instructions below. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Estimates # You can estimate the length of a project, and then monitor progress and compare estimated vs tracked time to see how well you and your team perform. Estimates are useful because they let you see if you charge enough for projects. Plus,\u00a0estimates can help you get better at estimating future projects. For example, when you compare estimated vs actually tracked time on a project, you get a better sense of how long a project like that takes, which helps you give better quotes to clients and set better budgets. There are two types of estimates in Clockify: Manual estimate (for the whole project) Task-based estimate To set an estimate for the whole project, go to that project\u2019s Settings tab, select Time estimate, and type your estimate in hours under Manual . Another option is to set estimates on tasks by selecting Task-based estimate. Then, the estimate field will appear for each task on the project\u2019s Task page, and your whole project estimate will be a sum of all individual task estimates. If you have fixed fee projects, you can set estimates in monetary values using project budget . Project status # When you and your team start tracking time for projects and tasks, you\u2019ll be able to track progress on each project using Project status. Each project will display a status next to it, for example, 15 (of 25h), which means you estimated 25h and your team tracked 15h. You can get more details about project status by clicking the bar icon\u00a0or the project\u2019s Status tab. Project status lets you see\u00a0progress at a glance. You can see: Total tracked time, and how much of it is billable How much you\u2019ve earned on the project Time breakdown for each task (assignee, estimate, how much of it was tracked, and how much money you\u2019ve earned on each task) In the tasks table breakdown, you can sort tasks columns by clicking on a column by which you wish to sort tasks. You can also hide completed tasks by choosing Show active in the task filter at the top right corner of the table. Admins can view status for all projects. Project managers can always see status for the projects they manage. Regular users can see status for their projects, unless you disable it in workspace settings. Estimates in reports # You can also see and export estimates in the Summary report , alongside your tracked time. To see estimates, switch the Show estimates and you\u2019ll see the estimate column when you have the report grouped by either project or task. Getting project status in PDF # When you\u2019re on a Projects page or on the status page of some individual project, you can get a nice print-friendly view by going to your browser\u2019s options and clicking Print (or press Ctrl/Cmd+P). When you\u2019re in the browser\u2019s print mode, you\u2019ll get an option to save the page as PDF.

When the timer is running, the favicon in the browser will change from black to blue so you have a visual cue to see if you maybe forgot to start or stop the timer. Also, Clockify will display how long the timer is running in the tab. Continuing time entries # When you continue working on something, you can start a timer for that activity in one click. To continue a time entry, find the time entry you want to continue recording in your timesheet and click the play icon. Clockify will copy all the info (description, project, billability, and tags) and the timer will start ticking. Shortcuts # Keyboard shortcuts can be used on the Time Tracker page and will only work when you are not editing any fields (when your cursor is not active). n = start N ew timer; c = C ontinue latest entry. s = S top current timer; m = switch to M anual mode; You can also use shortcuts in Mac app and browser extension . Auto-complete # You can easily find your old entries\u2019 details with the auto-complete option. Simply start typing and a drop-down will open with up to 8 suggestions, which will be sorted chronologically. You need to enter at least two characters and they can be related to any of these categories you previously entered: description, project, client, task, or tag. Otherwise, if you just click on the empty description ( What are you working on ) field, it will pull your 8 latest time entries. Autocomplete list takes into consideration last 250 time entries from the last 60 days. If an entry isn\u2019t there, it won\u2019t show up in autocomplete. Change start time of the running timer # You can change the start time while the timer is running by clicking on the running time. Then you can manually type in your real start time. This is useful when you start an activity but you can\u2019t start the timer at that moment (e.g. you\u2019re on a meeting and are away from the computer). Running multiple timers # You can have only one running timer on a workspace. But, if you have multiple workspaces, you can have multiple timers running at the same time, one in each workspace. You can quickly switch between workspaces by clicking on the menu in the upper-right corner and choose another workspace. You can also switch workspaces in all the apps created with that account. Keep in mind that all the time you track in one workspace will not be available in the other workspaces. Each workspace is a self-contained account (but you can transfer entries between workspaces). Grouping and ungrouping time entries # Time entries for the same activity are displayed as a single time entry. Editing the group will edit each individual time entry in the group. If you wish to see entries in chronological order, you can disable time grouping in your Profile Settings: Click on the profile icon in the upper right corner and open Profile Settings Check/uncheck the Group similar time entries option Time tracking apps # In addition to tracking time in your browser tab, you can also track time from a mobile app ( Android / iOS ), desktop app ( Mac , Windows , Linux ), and browser extension ( Chrome/Firefox ). By using a dedicated time tracking app, you don\u2019t have to keep Clockify open in a tab all the time. Instead, you can track time from wherever it\u2019s most convenient for you.

Later, see their tracked time and attendance in reports. If you have employees who don\u2019t have an email, you can add them as limited members who only clock in via the kiosk. Kiosk is a free feature available to all users. For an overall guidance on how to clock in and out via kiosk, watch the video and follow the instructions below. User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app. Create kiosk # In order to create kiosk, kiosk mode needs to be enabled on the workspace in question. Navigate to the Workspace settings and activate kiosk in the General tab. To create kiosk: Go to the Kiosk page from the sidebar Click Create kiosk Enter kiosk name (no special characters allowed; e.g. Westside Bar: Staff) Select members who can clock in via that kiosk Select Default project to which all time on that kiosk will be tracked (optional) Check Require PIN if assignees need to enter their personal PIN before they can clock in Click Create You can also choose a task in the Default project field. So for example, you can create one kiosk for one type of workers where all the time will be tracked to Project: TaskA, and another where time will be tracked to Project: TaskB. If you have breaks enabled, you can also choose a default project/task for the break time entries. Kiosk also allows you to clock in to chosen project or task and switch between different projects and tasks during the day in the Workspace settings by enabling Allow switching between projects and tasks inside kiosk. If the default project is defined, the user can choose if they\u2019d like to clock in to the default project or change the project and choose a different one. Time in Clockify is categorized by Client, Project, and Task by default. You can change the labels into something that better suits your business in the workspace settings (e.g. Department, Location, Job\u2026). Launch kiosk # This action is performed by admins, unless set up differently in the Kiosk launch settings . Kiosk can be launched via a link on any device in its browser (any tablet, computer, or phone, no special equipment needed).

If you activate the Kiosk login required option, admins/managers need to log in to kiosk before users can clock in. If this option is deactivated, anyone with the kiosk link will be able to launch kiosk. To create and launch multiple kiosks, upgrade to any paid plan . To close a kiosk: Select your admin profile on the kiosk Enter your PIN (if required) Choose Close kiosk in the lower left corner. Closing a kiosk doesn\u2019t clock out existing users, so make sure everyone\u2019s clocked out or they won\u2019t be able to stop their timer (admin will have to do it for them in the web app by visiting their Calendar and stopping the timer from their currently running time block). Kiosk remains open for 24 hours by default. After that, the session expires and admin needs to relaunch it again. To set a custom duration after which the session expires, upgrade to STANDARD or higher. To launch the kiosk on more than one device or location, upgrade to any PAID plan. Clock in # Go to the device that has your kiosk set up Select your profile Enter you PIN (if required) Tap Clock in People who are clocked-in will have a green dot next to them on the kiosk list.

You will learn how to access various types of reports, filter by specific criteria like date, project, or client, and customize reports to fit your needs. Overview of reports # Clockify offers several types of reports to help you track time and expenses: Summary report This report groups your time entries by various criteria, such as project, client, user, tag, or date. It\u2019s ideal for getting an overview of your time entries over a specific date range. Detailed report This report shows all the details of your time entries, without grouping or summarizing. It provides a line-by-line breakdown of each time entry. Weekly report Weekly report is great for weekly tracking, since it shows time entries grouped by user or project within a fixed week range. Navigate the reports # To access and navigate the reports section: Go to the Reports page in the sidebar If the Reports page is not visible, it might be restricted by your workspace admins. Choose between the Summary , Detailed , or Weekly report, depending on your needs Filter your reports # Clockify allows you to filter your reports by several criteria to get the data you need. Here\u2019s how to filter your reports: Choose time period At the top of the Report page, select the Calendar date range for the report. You can choose custom date ranges or predefined options like last week or this month. Filter by Project, Client, or User Project : Filter by active or archived projects Client : Filter by active or archived clients User : Filter by specific team members, or show all users (active/inactive) Filter by entry status, tag, or task You can filter time entries by status (approved, pending, etc.), description , tag , or task to get a more granular view of the time tracked. Reports data # Once you have applied the relevant filters, the report will display the following key data points: Total time worked This is the total amount of time tracked during the selected period. It includes both billable and non-billable hours. Billable hours Billable hours are the time entries that are considered chargeable to a client or project. These will be separated from non-billable hours in the report. Project summaries If you group your report by project, you will see a breakdown of total time tracked for each project. This is useful for understanding how much time was spent on each project. Total amount For billable hours, the report will also display the total monetary value based on the rate set for each project or client. Customize and export reports # Clockify offers a variety of options for customizing and exporting your reports: Customize the report for export You can adjust the filters and groupings to create a report tailored to your needs, whether you need a summary, detailed breakdown, or weekly overview. Export report in one of the formats (PDF, Excel or CSV) Save report For more precise reporting, you can enable or disable rounding for the time entries in the report if you want time tracked in minutes to be rounded up or down to the nearest increment. FAQ # Can I customize the date range for the reports? # Yes, you can customize the date range for each report using the Calendar option at the top right of the page. How do I see billable hours in the reports? # In the Summary Report and Detailed Report , you can see the billable hours for each entry. Billable hours will be displayed separately from non-billable hours, helping you track which time entries are chargeable. How do I filter the report by specific tasks or tags? # Use the filters section of the report to filter by task , tag , or entry status . This allows you to narrow down the data to only show specific tasks or entries related to a certain tag. Was this article helpful? Submit Cancel Thank you!

These features work in specific ways, and here\u2019s a complete breakdown. Estimate progress bars can exceed 100% # When your tracked time or budget goes beyond the estimate, Clockify does not stop tracking. Instead, the project progress bar will go past 100% to reflect overage. 125% = 25% over the estimate This behavior is intentional and helps you measure how much you\u2019ve exceeded Recurring budgets reset automatically # If you\u2019ve set a weekly, monthly, or yearly recurring estimate, the budget will reset automatically at the end of each cycle based on the project\u2019s start date. What this means: Budgets don\u2019t disappear; they just start fresh for the new period Project status only shows progress for the current cycle How to preserve historical data Before the reset date: Go to the Projects page Click Export (CSV or Excel) The export includes tracked time, budget, estimate, overage, progress, and more This serves as a backup or a reference if you want to compare performance across periods. Alerts may not trigger if not configured at that threshold # Estimate alerts are only sent for thresholds that are explicitly defined. Example: If you set an alert only at 80% and not at 100%, you won\u2019t receive anything when the estimate is fully reached. What to do: Set alerts at all relevant thresholds (e.g., 50%, 80%, 100%) under workspace settings -> Alerts. Alerts are not retroactive # If you create or edit an alert rule after a threshold is already passed, Clockify will not trigger the alert retroactively. Clockify doesn\u2019t block tracking beyond estimates # Estimates are for informational purposes only. Clockify will not automatically prevent time tracking on those projects once an estimate or a budget is used up. What you can do instead: Set up alerts to notify when the estimate is near or exceeded Use the Project status page to view the current status Create clear internal guidelines for stopping work manually Optional control method: Once the project reaches its estimate or a budget limit, an Admin or a Project Manager can: Go to the Projects page Click on the project Select Archive This will prevent team members from tracking additional time on that project, effectively enforcing a soft stop. Time estimate vs. Budget estimate # Clockify allows you to track a project\u2019s progress using two types of estimates: time estimates and budget estimates. A time estimate refers to the number of hours you expect to spend on a project. It\u2019s based purely on tracked time entries and is ideal when you\u2019re managing internal workload, capacity, or effort. A budget estimate, on the other hand, refers to the monetary value you expect to bill for a project. It depends on having hourly rates set up, either at the project or task level. Task-level estimates also support alerts # You can assign estimates and alerts to tasks, not just full projects. You can notify: Task assignees Project Manager Workspace admin Only one role can be selected per alert rule, but you can create multiple rules to notify several roles. Estimate alerts are only sent once per threshold # You\u2019ll receive one alert per threshold (e.g., 80%, 100%). If the progress jumps over multiple thresholds at once (e.g., from 75% to 95%), only the highest one will trigger. An alert for a threshold will only trigger again if the project drops below that value and then crosses it again. Was this article helpful? Submit Cancel Thank you!

This guide explains how it all works, from accruals and balances to policy structure and customization. Time off requests are linked to policies # To request time off, a user must be assigned to a Time Off Policy. Each policy defines whether: Approval is required Time entries are created automatically Accruals are enabled Negative balances are allowed The user can take half-days Time is measured in days or hours How Approvals work # Time off approvals apply only to Time Off Policies, not Holiday Policies. You can choose whether time off requests require approval: If disabled, time off requests are automatically approved If enabled, requests must be reviewed and approved by designated users Who can approve time off requests? # When setting up a Time Off Policy, you\u2019ll have three options: Admins Only Admins can approve time off requests Admins will receive notifications and see all pending requests across the workspace Team Managers Only Team Managers can approve requests for users they manage Admins will not be notified unless they\u2019re also assigned as Team Managers, but will still see all requests If admins want to receive notifications as well, they must be added as Team Managers to the relevant users or teams. Specific members You can select specific members (from your entire Clockify team) to act as approvers Selected members will receive notifications and be able to approve time off How Accruals work # Accruals are optional and apply only to Time Off Policies, not Holiday Policies. If accruals are enabled, you can define how much time off a user earns over time. You can choose to accrue: Per month (e.g., 1.5 days/month) Per year (e.g., 18 days/year) When is time added? Monthly accruals are added on\u00a0 the 1st of every month Yearly accruals are added on January 1st Can I accrue fractional values? Yes, you\u2019re not limited to whole days. You can use decimals like: 0.01 days per month (for granular setups) 0.05, 1.25, or any custom value you need One policy applies to all assignees # All users assigned to the same policy will share the same rules, including: Accrual rate Approval requirements Allowed time units (days/hours) If your team members have different accrual rules, for example: One employee earns 2 days/year Another earns 5 days/year Consider creating separate policies for each group or individual. Time off can be tracked in days or hours # You can choose the unit of time used in each policy: Days (by default) Hours This also applies to accruals.

Understanding user roles and permissions is essential for effective collaboration and efficient workflow management. This article provides an overview of the user roles and their corresponding access permissions in Clockify. For more information about Admin & owner , Manager and Regular user roles and their access permissions, check out these individual articles. Please keep in mind that CAKE.com permissions also apply, as CAKE.com operates as the central organization. For more details on CAKE.com permissions and how they affect individual products, please refer to this article . Roles # Admins & owners # Admins and owners have the highest level of access and control within Clockify. They are responsible for managing workspace settings, user permissions, and overall workspace administration. Owners hold the highest level of authority in the Clockify app. As the individuals who created the workspace, they possess unparalleled control over workspace management. Owners have all the privileges of admins but also possess exclusive rights such as the ability to set up Single Sign-On (SSO). Additionally, owners are the only ones who can initiate the deletion of the entire workspace, which occurs if they leave or delete their account. Admins have significant control and authority within the Clockify app. They are responsible for managing workspace settings, user permissions, and overall workspace administration. Admins can perform actions such as creating and managing projects, assigning user roles, and defining billable rates. Managers # There are two types of managers in Clockify: Project Managers Team Managers Manager role is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan. Project Managers can view tracked time on their projects, manage project details, launch Kiosk if enabled and approve submitted timesheets. Team Managers , on the other hand, can view all tracked time of their team members, edit their team\u2019s time if enabled, and approve submitted timesheets. Regular users # Regular users have limited permissions compared to admins and managers. They can track time, view their own and others\u2019 time entries, and perform basic project-related tasks such as creating and editing tasks. Regular users can also see other members of the workspace and participate in projects assigned to them. Actions # Track Time Regular users can track time on public and private projects, while managers,* admins and owners have access to projects. *Depending on their type and permissions See Time Regular users can view their own and others\u2019 time entries based on permissions, whereas managers, admins and owners have broader visibility across projects and users. Add/Edit Time Regular users can edit their own time entries within certain constraints, while team managers, admins and owners have broader editing capabilities.

Tasks provide you with an extra level of hierarchy and can function as sub-projects.

For more advanced task management, it\u2019s best to use a dedicated project management tool like Plaky , Tr ello , JIRA , etc. For example, you can name tasks by type of work (\u201cFront-end programming\u201d, \u201cWriting\u201d, \u201cDesigning\u201d) and later sub-group time entries by task in the Summary report to see how much time each activity took. Create tasks # To create task: Go to a project Open Tasks tab Type task name Click Add and people will then be able to choose it when tracking time. You can: Indicate who works on which task by selecting an assignee Set an estimate for each task once you enabled it from the Project Settings tab (this can be useful if you\u2019ve quoted your client a certain number of hours for each type of work so you can track how things go along) To change task name, simply click on its name and type what you want. By default, owners and admins can create tasks. However, this set of permissions can be modified if Who can create projects and clients is set to Admins and managers or Anyone in the Workspace settings . Who can create tasks if selected: Admins (default): admins Admins and project managers : admins and project manager Anyone : admins, projects managers, team managers, regular users Mark tasks as done # When you\u2019re finished with some task, you can mark it as done so it doesn\u2019t get in the way: Done tasks don\u2019t appear on project page until you select Show done or Show all tasks Done tasks don\u2019t appear in the project picker when tracking time Tracked time for done tasks is shown in reports Marking tasks as done is really useful if you have a lot of tasks on projects, and you organize projects as to-dos (the other workflow is to put types of activities as tasks, like coding or design, in which case there\u2019s no need to close tasks). Assign users to tasks # When a\u00a0task has Anyone as the assignee, everyone who has access to that project can select and track time on the task. If a task has a particular user or group as the assignee, only that person can select and track time on the task. If it\u2019s a private project, you\u2019ll have to add the person to that project first. Add tasks from a template # If you often create projects with the same task structure, you can set up a template so you don\u2019t have to add these tasks one by one every time you create a new project. Projects you create with an existing template will have settings such as Tasks, Billable Rates, Estimates, and Team already applied. Project templates is a paid feature, which you can enable once you upgrade your account. Delete tasks # To delete a task, you first need to mark it as complete. After that, click on task\u2019s options again and you\u2019ll see the Delete option. Only admins and project managers can delete tasks. Once a task is deleted, all time entries for that task will become without a task (but they\u2019ll retain the project).

When you record time in Clockify web, time from Profile Settings is used. Then, Clockify converts that time to UTC and sends the converted value to the server. When you later view the time in reports, the time zone from your Profile Settings is used. For example: J\u00f6rg from Germany works from 09-10 AM (UTC+2) and records that time in Clockify. Clockify converts it to 07-08 AM (its corresponding UTC value) and stores it in the database. When Emily from New York runs the report, she sees that J\u00f6rg worked from 03-04 AM (displayed in her UTC-4 time). This assumes the system time zone and the time zone in the Profile Settings match. If they don\u2019t match, you will get a notification to fix it. If you don\u2019t fix it,\u00a0 your timesheet and reports will show different start and end time from the one you recorded. If you wish to see a report in a different time zone (e.g. you want to analyze report for users in their native time zone), you can change your time zone in Profile Settings and then create a shared report (filtered by certain users) that you can open at any time (shared report remembers the time zone during its creation, so you can safely switch to your time zone and view the shared report in the time zone you\u2019ve used during creation).

Reports # There are three types of reports in Clockify: Summary, Detailed, and Weekly report. The best thing about the Summary report is that it groups your time entries in lots of different ways (by project, client, user, group, tag, month, week and date), so you can get the data exactly as you need it for any date range you want. If you\u2019d like to view your employees\u2019 hours, the most common scenario to get this info would be to group the data by User and subgroup it by Project. You can further subgroup it by Task. This way you\u2019ll get a breakdown of your employees\u2019 hours by specific tasks while working on certain project. Another useful way to view your employees\u2019 hours is by grouping them by Date so you\u2019ll see the total of hours each employee tracked per day. This is great if you need to get a bi-weekly or monthly report of your team\u2019s hours so the Weekly report doesn\u2019t cut it. This report has three levels of grouping so you can have a more granular view of your data. The Weekly report is great if you check your employees\u2019 hours each week so this is a set date range that works for you. You can also get a breakdown by User or Project. While there\u2019s no option to change a date range in the Weekly report to show more than one week at a time, you can use the Summary report, select any date range at the top right corner of the page and group the report by User and Date to see the total of hours each employee tracked per day. The Detailed report will let you see all the details of your team\u2019s time entries one by one, not grouped or summarized. It\u2019s also possible for an Admin to edit the team\u2019s time entries in this report. You can export any of the reports in PDF, Excel, CSV. Individual employee report # If you\u2019d like to get data for a single employee make sure to use filters in the reports. This way you can select a particular user and only get their hours in the report. Customize reports # If Clockify\u2019s built-in reports don\u2019t provide the structure you need, simply export the Detailed report as CSV and you can create any kind of report you want using pivot tables in Excel/Google Sheets. Employees\u2019 hours in Timesheet # If you\u2019re on the paid subscription plan, you will be able to see employees\u2019 timesheets and add time for them directly from the Timesheets page. This is very similar to the Weekly report if you filter it by a specific employee and group it by Project. You can even use the printing option in your browser (or shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+P) then select the option Save as PDF to save the Timesheet on your computer and print it if necessary. Current work and tracked time # You can see all currently active timers of your employees in your dashboard. Simply select the Team dashboard and check the Last Activity section for In progress timers. The Dashboard is also the place where you can check who did not track time in a particular date range. Simply select the date range you need and sort the Total Tracked column in ascending order. All users with 0 h did not track time in that particular date range. This is a good way to check if your employees\u2019 met their weekly/monthly quota of hours. Another way to see who hasn\u2019t tracked any time is to go to Weekly reports, group it by User, and click Show users without time . The main benefit of this method is that you can for example filter by approval status and see who doesn\u2019t have any approved time in a given week. Below or above target notification # You can set targets and reminders for your employees (e.g. 8h/day). Then, if someone forgets to log their time, Clockify will send them an email reminder to fill their timesheets. Or, if someone tracks too much time and is over their target, admins and managers can receive an email about it. Tracked time not visible in reports # Sometimes employees claim they have tracked time, but somehow you can\u2019t seem to find it in your reports. This happens when employees track time in a different workspace. When users create a Clockify account they usually get their own personal workspace (unless they\u2019ve signed up to Clockify via the invitation link). So sometimes users mistakenly track time in their personal workspace rather than the one they\u2019ve been invited to by their managers. If you\u2019re struggling to see your employees\u2019 hours, make sure to check if they tracked time in the correct workspace.

When you first register at Clockify, you\u2019ll automatically get a Clockify workspace and your CAKE.com Account with an organization in it. You can also join a Clockify workspace in an existing CAKE.com organization . A workspace contains all the time entries, projects, people, and settings. With a single CAKE.com Account, you can create or join multiple Clockify workspaces. These workspaces are separate entities, each with their own unique set of users, projects, and time entries. Multiple workspaces are useful when you want to have a separate account for each sub-company or a department. This way, things won\u2019t mix up and you can have different access levels . For example, if you have two companies or departments, you can create two workspaces, and invite different people to each one. Then, you can switch between them as needed. Or, you can be a team member in one workspace and track time for the company you work for, plus have a personal workspace where you\u2019ll keep track of personal stuff and be admin. Everything in Clockify is tied to a specific workspace, so time entries you made in one workspace aren\u2019t visible in another.
