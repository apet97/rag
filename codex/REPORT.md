# Executive Summary

Status: Completed a fast, end-to-end code review and diagnostics pass for the Clockify RAG tool. Endpoint is unreachable from this host; performed static analysis and prepared smokes and scripts to validate when reachable.

Top 5 Risks
- Embedding dimension drift (fixed): async client previously sourced `EMBEDDING_DIM` independently. Patched to import from `src.embeddings` to avoid 384 vs 768 mismatches.
- FAISS reconstruct hard-fail (fixed): IndexManager raised if `reconstruct` unsupported, crashing startup. Now degrades gracefully; hybrid path falls back to vector-only.
- Ingest/meta schema mismatch: `ingest_from_jsonl.py` emits a list `meta.json` while `IndexManager` expects an object with `rows`/`chunks` and `dim`. Use `embed.py` or update ingest script if needed.
- Endpoint mismatch in ingest: `ingest_from_jsonl.py` uses `/api/embed` with `{input: ...}` while other code uses `/api/embeddings` with `{prompt: ...}`. Align if you rely on that script.
- Namespace env pitfalls: Hard-setting `NAMESPACES` to include non-existent indexes (e.g., `langchain`) causes startup failure. Prefer auto-derivation by leaving it unset.

Whatâ€™s Fixed (in FIXES.patch)
- Unified embedding dim source across modules (src/embeddings_async.py imports `EMBEDDING_DIM`).
- Graceful degrade for FAISS reconstruct (src/index_manager.py) to avoid startup crashes on unsupported index types.
- Verified search serialization removes raw embeddings across vector and hybrid paths.

Deliverables
- FILE_TREE.md: concise view of the repo.
- CONFIG_AUDIT.md: env/config surface and sane defaults.
- ENDPOINT_CHECK.log: endpoint unreachable notes with curl timeouts.
- KB_COVERAGE.md: counts and largest files under `data/` and `docs/`.
- DIAGNOSTICS.md: issues with file:line references and fixes.
- FIXES.patch: minimal patch with the above changes.
- TEST_PLAN.md: concrete manual and automated checks.
- scripts/: endpoint_smoke.sh, rag_smoke.py, count_pages.py, dims_check.py.

Recommended Next Steps
- Run `bash codex/scripts/endpoint_smoke.sh` from an environment that can reach `10.127.0.192:11434`.
- Execute `python3 codex/scripts/dims_check.py` to ensure dims match across namespaces and configured env.
- If using `ingest_from_jsonl.py`, standardize to `/api/embeddings` and emit the same meta schema as `embed.py`.
- Start the API with a valid `API_TOKEN` and verify `/search` and `/chat` smokes; confirm no `embedding` fields leak in responses.
- Consider adding a CI job that runs count_pages.py and dims_check.py to catch KB or index regressions.
